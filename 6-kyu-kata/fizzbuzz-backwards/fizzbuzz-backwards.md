## Kata Description


Traditionally in FizzBuzz, multiples of 3 are replaced by "Fizz" and multiples of 5 are replaced by "Buzz". But we could also play FizzBuzz with any other integer pair `[n, m]` whose multiples are replaced with Fizz and Buzz. 



For a sequence of numbers, Fizzes, Buzzes and FizzBuzzes, find the numbers whose multiples are being replaced by Fizz and Buzz. Return them as an array `[n, m]`



The Fizz and Buzz numbers will always be integers between 1 and 50, and the sequence will have a maximum length of 100. The Fizz and Buzz numbers might be equal, and might be equal to 1.



## Examples

* Classic FizzBuzz; multiples of 3 are replaced by Fizz, multiples of 5 are replaced by Buzz:

```

[1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", 6]  ==>  [3, 5] 

```

* Multiples of 2 are replaced by Fizz, multiples of 3 are replaced by Buzz:

```

[1, "Fizz", "Buzz", "Fizz", 5, "FizzBuzz"]  ==>  [2, 3]

```

* Multiples of 2 are replaced by Fizz and Buzz:

```

[1, "FizzBuzz", 3, "FizzBuzz", 5, "FizzBuzz"]  ==>  [2, 2]

```

* Fizz = 1, Buzz = 6:

```

["Fizz", "Fizz", "Fizz", "Fizz", "Fizz", "FizzBuzz"]  ==>  [1, 6]

```
