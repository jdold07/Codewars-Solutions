## Kata Description


Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.



As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(



So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with `[1, 1, 1]` as a starting input (AKA *signature*), we have this sequence:



```

[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]

```



But what if we started with `[0, 0, 1]` as a signature? As starting with `[0, 1]` instead of `[1, 1]` basically *shifts* the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:



```

[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]

```



Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a **signature** array/list, returns **the first n elements - signature included** of the so seeded sequence.



Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if `n == 0`, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)
