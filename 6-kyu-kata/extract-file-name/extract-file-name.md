## Kata Description


You have to extract a portion of the file name as follows:



* Assume it will start with date represented as long number

* Followed by an underscore

* You'll have then a filename with an extension

* it will always have an extra extension at the end



Inputs:

---

```

1231231223123131_FILE_NAME.EXTENSION.OTHEREXTENSION



1_This_is_an_otherExample.mpg.OTHEREXTENSIONadasdassdassds34



1231231223123131_myFile.tar.gz2

```



Outputs

---



```

FILE_NAME.EXTENSION



This_is_an_otherExample.mpg



myFile.tar

```



Acceptable characters for random tests:



`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_-0123456789`



The recommended way to solve it is using RegEx and specifically groups.
