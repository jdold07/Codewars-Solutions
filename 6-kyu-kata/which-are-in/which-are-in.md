## Kata Description


Given two arrays of strings `a1` and `a2` return a sorted array `r` in lexicographical order of the strings of `a1` which are substrings of strings of `a2`.



#### Example 1:

`a1 = ["arp", "live", "strong"]`



`a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]`



returns `["arp", "live", "strong"]`



#### Example 2:

`a1 = ["tarp", "mice", "bull"]`



`a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]`



returns `[]`



#### Notes: 

- Arrays are written in "general" notation. See "Your Test Cases" for examples in your language.

- In Shell bash `a1` and `a2` are strings. The return is a string where words are separated by commas.

- Beware: In some languages `r` must be without duplicates.
