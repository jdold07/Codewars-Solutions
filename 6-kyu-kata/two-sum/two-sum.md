## Kata Description


Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: `(index1, index2)`.



For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.



The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).



Based on: http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/



```elixir

two_sum([1, 2, 3], 4) == {0, 2}

```

```lambdacalc

two-sum < 1 2 3 > 4 # returns (0, 2) or (2, 0)

```

```cpp

two_sum({1, 2, 3}, 4); // returns {0, 2} or {2, 0}

```

```go

TwoSum([]int{1, 2, 3}, 4) // returns [2]int{0, 2}

// the go translation has an issue where random tests accept either [2]int{0, 2} or [2]int{2, 0}, but fixed tests and sample tests demand the resulting slice to be sorted!

// untill it's fixed, please sort your result in go.

```

```haskell

twoSum [1, 2, 3] 4 === (0, 2)

```

```javascript

twoSum([1, 2, 3], 4) // returns [0, 2] or [2, 0]

```

```python

two_sum([1, 2, 3], 4) # returns [0, 2] or [2, 0]

```

```rust

two_sum(&[1, 2, 3], 4) // return (0, 2) or (2, 0)

```

```cobol

      TwoSum([1, 2, 3], 4) => result = [1, 3]

```
