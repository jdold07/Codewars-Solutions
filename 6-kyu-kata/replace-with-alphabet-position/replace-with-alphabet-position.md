## Kata Description


Welcome.



In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.



If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.



`"a" = 1`, `"b" = 2`, etc.



## Example <!-- unlisted languages will use the first entry. please keep python up top. -->



```python

alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

```

```javascript

alphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

```

```scala

alphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

```

```haskell

alphabetPosition "The sunset sets at twelve o' clock."

```

```cobol

      AlphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

```

```groovy

Kata.alphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

```

```crystal

alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

```

```julia

```

```coffeescript

```

```crystal

```coffeescript

```

```nasm

text:  db  "The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.",0h0

```



Should return `"20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"` ( as a string )
