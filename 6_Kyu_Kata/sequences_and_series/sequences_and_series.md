## Kata Description


Have a look at the following numbers.



```

 n | score

---+-------

 1 |  50

 2 |  150

 3 |  300

 4 |  500

 5 |  750

```



Can you find a pattern in it? If so, then write a function `getScore(n)`/`get_score(n)`/`GetScore(n)` which returns the score for any positive number `n`.





___Note___

Real test cases consists of 100 random cases where `1 <= n <= 10000`
