## Kata Description


Write a function that takes a string of braces, and determines if the order of the braces is valid. It should return `true` if the string is valid, and `false` if it's invalid.





This Kata is similar to the [Valid Parentheses](https://www.codewars.com/kata/valid-parentheses) Kata, but introduces new characters: brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`. Thanks to `@arnedag` for the idea!





All input strings will be nonempty, and will only consist of parentheses, brackets and curly braces: `()[]{}`. 







### What is considered Valid?





A string of braces is considered valid if all braces are matched with the correct brace.





## Examples



```

"(){}[]"   =>  True

"([{}])"   =>  True

"(}"       =>  False

"[(])"     =>  False

"[({})](]" =>  False

```
