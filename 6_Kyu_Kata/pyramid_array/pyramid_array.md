## Kata Description


Write a function that when given a number >= 0, returns an Array of ascending length subarrays.



```

pyramid(0) => [ ]

pyramid(1) => [ [1] ]

pyramid(2) => [ [1], [1, 1] ]

pyramid(3) => [ [1], [1, 1], [1, 1, 1] ]

```



**Note:** the subarrays should be filled with `1`s



```if:c

Subarrays should not overlap; this will be tested.

Dont forget to de-allocate memory in `free_pyramid()`

```
