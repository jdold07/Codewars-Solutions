## Kata Description


FizzBuzz is often one of the first programming puzzles people learn. Now undo it with reverse FizzBuzz!



Write a function that accepts a string, which will always be a valid section of FizzBuzz. Your function must return an array that contains the numbers in order to generate the given section of FizzBuzz.



Notes:

- If the sequence can appear multiple times within FizzBuzz, return the numbers that generate the first instance of that sequence.

- All numbers in the sequence will be greater than zero.

- You will never receive an empty sequence.





## Examples

```

reverse_fizzbuzz("1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz")        -->  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

reverse_fizzbuzz("Fizz 688 689 FizzBuzz")  -->  [687, 688, 689, 690]

reverse_fizzbuzz("Fizz Buzz")              -->  [9, 10]

```
