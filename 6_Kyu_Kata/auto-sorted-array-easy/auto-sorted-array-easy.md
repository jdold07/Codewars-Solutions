## Kata Description


Create a derived collection object that automatically sorts itself when its member methods are invoked. Inspecting (console.log) an instance of the collection should only return the values and not the methods.



The collection should be instantiated with 2 parameters (dir, init)



- dir: `asc` || `desc` -- Determines the direction of the sort  

  (Must throw an error if `dir` is neither of these values)



- init: number -- Identical to `number` in Array(number)





Methods:



- `insert([element1[, ...[, elementN]]])`: Adds value(s) to the collection, sorts collection and returns the collection length.



- `pop()`: Removes a value from the end of the collection and returns the removed value.



- `shift()`: Removes a value from the start of the collection and returns the removed value.



The collection should get re-sorted on every `insert`.
