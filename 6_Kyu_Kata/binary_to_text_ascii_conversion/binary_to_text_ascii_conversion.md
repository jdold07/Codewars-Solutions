## Kata Description


Write a function that takes in a binary string and returns the equivalent decoded text (the text is ASCII encoded).



Each 8 bits on the binary string represent 1 character on the ASCII table.



The input string will always be a valid binary string.



Characters can be in the range from "00000000" to "11111111" (inclusive)



Note: In the case of an empty binary string your function should return an empty string.
