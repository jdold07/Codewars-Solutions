## Kata Description


Each exclamation mark's weight is 2; each question mark's weight is 3. Putting two strings `left` and `right` on the balance - are they balanced?

 

If the left side is more heavy, return `"Left"`; if the right side is more heavy, return `"Right"`; if they are balanced, return `"Balance"`.



## Examples



```python

"!!", "??"     -->  "Right"

"!??", "?!!"   -->  "Left"

"!?!!", "?!?"  -->  "Left"

"!!???!????", "??!!?!!!!!!!"  -->  "Balance"

```

```haskell

-- For Haskell use the Comparison type defined in Preloaded code

-- data Comparison = Left | Right | Balance deriving (Show, Eq, Enum, Bounded)



balance :: String -> String -> Comparison



balance "!!" "??" == Right

balance "!??" "?!!" == Left

balance "!?!!" "?!?" == Left

balance "!!???!????" "??!!?!!!!!!!" == Balance

```
