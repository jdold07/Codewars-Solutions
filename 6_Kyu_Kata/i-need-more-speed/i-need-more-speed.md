## Kata Description


Write a function that will take in any `array` and reverse it. <br/>



Sounds simple doesn't it? <br/>



<b>NOTES:</b>



* Array should be reversed in place! (no need to return it)

* Usual builtins have been deactivated. Don't count on them.

* You'll have to do it fast enough, so think about performances
