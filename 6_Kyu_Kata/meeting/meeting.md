## Kata Description


John has invited some friends. His list is:

```

s = "Fred:Corwill;Wilfred:Corwill;Barney:Tornbull;Betty:Tornbull;Bjon:Tornbull;Raphael:Corwill;Alfred:Corwill";

```



Could you make a program that 

- makes this string uppercase

- gives it sorted in alphabetical order by last name. 



When the last names are the same, sort them by first name.

Last name and first name of a guest come in the result between parentheses separated by a comma.



So the result of function `meeting(s)` will be:

```

"(CORWILL, ALFRED)(CORWILL, FRED)(CORWILL, RAPHAEL)(CORWILL, WILFRED)(TORNBULL, BARNEY)(TORNBULL, BETTY)(TORNBULL, BJON)"

```

It can happen that in two distinct families with the same family name two people have the same first name too.



#### Notes

- You can see another examples in the "Sample tests".
