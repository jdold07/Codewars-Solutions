## Kata Description


Your task is to write a higher order function for chaining together

a list of unary functions. In other words, it should return a function

that does a left fold on the given functions.



```python

chained([a,b,c,d])(input)

```

Should yield the same result as

```python

d(c(b(a(input))))

```
