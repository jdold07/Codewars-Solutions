## Kata Description


#About Caesar Cipher



Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique based on shifting each character by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.



For example, if the shift is 3, an encoded version of phrase "kata" will be:

```

k + 3 = n

a + 3 = d

t + 3 = w

a + 3 = d

```

In a case when "z" is reached, the algorithm wraps back to "a".

Example: "zen", key 3

```

z + 3 = c

e + 3 = h

n + 3 = q

```

The key for this cipher can be any non-negative integer. However, because there are 26 letters in English alphabet, any key larger than 26 can be thought about as key = key % 26.



#What to do



Your task is to write a function that will *encrypt* a phrase using Caesar Cipher and a given shift key and return it as a string. However, **the key should be increased by 1 with every word in a phrase**. For example, if the function is called with a phrase "divide et impera" and key 3, the encoding should be as follows:

```

- Shift the word "divide" by the key of 3

- Shift the word "et" by the key of 3 + 1 = 4

- Shift the word "impera" by the key of 3 + 2 = 5

```





#Important things to note:

- Guaranteed input will be of type string, **lowercase characters and spaces only**.

- Key can be any non-negative integer.
