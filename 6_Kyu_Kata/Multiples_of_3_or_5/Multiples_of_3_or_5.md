## Kata Description


If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.



Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 **below** the number passed in. 

Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).



**Note:** If the number is a multiple of **both** 3 and 5, only count it *once*.
