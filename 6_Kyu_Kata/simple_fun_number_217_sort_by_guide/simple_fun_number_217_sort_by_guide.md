## Kata Description


# Task



 You're given an array of positive integers `arr`, and an array `guide` of the same length. Sort array `arr` using array `guide` by the following rules:

```

if guide[i] = -1, arr[i] shouldn't be sorted;

if guide[i] ‚â† -1, arr[i] should be sorted, 

     and among all elements that should be sorted, 

     arr[i] should be the guide[i]th one (1-based).

```



## Input/Output





 - `[input]` integer array `arr`



  Array of positive integers.



  `1 ‚â§ a.length ‚â§ 100`



  `1 ‚â§ A[i] ‚â§ 10^4`



 

 - `[input]` integer array `guide`



  It is guaranteed that `guide.length = a.length`.





 - `[output]` an integer array



  Array sorted as described above.



### Example



 For

 

 `arr     = [56, 78, 3, 45, 4, 66, 2,  2, 4]`

 

 `guide = [3,  1, -1, -1, 2, -1, 4, -1, 5]`

 

 the output should be `[78,4,3,45,56,66,2,2,4]`



 Here's how `arr` was sorted:

```

Elements 3, 45, 66 and 2 don't need to be sorted, 

so we can put them in the resulting array right away:

[?, ?, 3, 45, ?, 66, ?, 2, ?].

Now we need to sort the remaining elements. 

According to the guide, 

they should be sorted in the following order:

[78, 4, 56, 2, 4]

Thus, the final answer is:

[78, 4, 3, 45, 56, 66, 2, 2, 4].

```
