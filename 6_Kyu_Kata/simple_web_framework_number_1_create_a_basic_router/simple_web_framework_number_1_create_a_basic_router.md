## Kata Description


In this Kata, you have to design a simple routing class for a web framework.



The router should accept bindings for a given url, http method and an action. 



Then, when a request with a bound url and method comes in, it should return the result of the action.



Example usage:



```python

router = Router()

router.bind('/hello', 'GET', lambda: 'hello world')



router.runRequest('/hello', 'GET') // returns 'hello world'

```

```javascript

var router = new Router;

router.bind('/hello', 'GET', function(){ return 'hello world'; });



router.runRequest('/hello', 'GET') // returns 'hello world';

```

```coffeescript

router = new Router

router.bind '/hello', 'GET', -> 'hello world'



router.runRequest '/hello', 'GET' # returns 'hello world'

```

```groovy

router = new Router()

router.bind("/hello", "GET", { -> "hello world" })

router.runRequest("/hello", "GET")  // returns "hello world"

```



```scala

router = new Router()

router.bind("/hello", "GET", () => "hello world")

router.runRequest("/hello", "GET")  // returns "hello world"

```



When asked for a route that doesn't exist, router should return:



```javascript

'Error 404: Not Found'

```

```python

'Error 404: Not Found'

```

```groovy

"Error 404: Not Found"

```

```scala

"Error 404: Not Found"

```



The router should also handle modifying existing routes. See the example tests for more details.
