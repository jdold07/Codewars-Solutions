## Kata Description


__Function composition__ is a mathematical operation that mainly presents itself in lambda calculus and computability. It is explained well [here](http://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/functions-composition.html), but this is my explanation, in simple mathematical notation:



```

f3 = compose( f1 f2 )

   Is equivalent to...

f3(a) = f1( f2( a ) )

```

~~~if-not:lambdacalc,ruby

Your task is to create a `compose` function to carry out this task, which will be passed two functions or lambdas. Ruby functions will be passed, and should return, either a proc or a lambda. Remember that the resulting composed function may be passed multiple arguments!

~~~

~~~if:ruby

Your task is to create a `compose` function to carry out this task, which will be passed two functions, and should return either a proc or a lambda. Remember that the resulting composed function may be passed multiple arguments!

~~~

~~~if:lambdacalc

Your task is to create a `compose` function to carry out this task.

```javascript

compose(f , g)(x)

=> f( g( x ) )

```

```ruby

compose(f , g).(x)

=> f.( g.( x ) )

```

```coffeescript

compose(f , g)(x)

=> f( g( x ) )

```

```clojure

((compose f  g) x)

=> (f (g x) )

```

```python

compose(f , g)(x)

=> f( g( x ) )

```

```lambdacalc

h = compose f g

h x # f (g x)

```





This kata is not available in haskell; that would be too easy!
