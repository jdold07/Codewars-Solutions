## Kata Description


The word `i18n` is a common abbreviation of `internationalization` in the developer community, used instead of typing the whole word and trying to spell it correctly. Similarly, `a11y` is an abbreviation of `accessibility`.



Write a function that takes a string and turns any and all "words" (see below) within that string of **length 4 or greater** into an abbreviation, following these rules:



* A "word" is a sequence of alphabetical characters. By this definition, any other character like a space or hyphen (eg. "elephant-ride") will split up a series of letters into two words (eg. "elephant" and "ride").

* The abbreviated version of the word should have the first letter, then the number of removed characters, then the last letter (eg. "elephant ride" => "e6t r2e").



## Example



```javascript

abbreviate("elephant-rides are really fun!")

//          ^^^^^^^^*^^^^^*^^^*^^^^^^*^^^*

// words (^):   "elephant" "rides" "are" "really" "fun"

//                123456     123     1     1234     1

// ignore short words:               X              X



// abbreviate:    "e6t"     "r3s"  "are"  "r4y"   "fun"

// all non-word characters (*) remain in place

//                     "-"      " "    " "     " "     "!"

=== "e6t-r3s are r4y fun!"

```
