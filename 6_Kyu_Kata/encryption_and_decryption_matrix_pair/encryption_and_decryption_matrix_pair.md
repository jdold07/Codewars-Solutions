# Description:

 Please complete the function `encryption` in accordance with the following rules:

 

 - Argument 1: `key`. It's a 5x5 matrix that contains 25 letters(No duplicate and always be lowercase). Given by a string, each row separated by "\n", each letter separated by spaces:

 ```

 key =

 a b c d e

 f g h i j

 k l m n o

 p q r s t

 u v w x y

 ```

 - Argument 2: `str`. It's the string which need to encrypt. The string always contains only lowercase letters.

 ```

 str = "example"

 ```

 - In encryption. At first we need group the string in accordance with two characters(If the length of the string is odd, the last letter is not encrypted):

 ```

 ex | am | pl | (e)

 ```

 - If the two letters are on the vertex of the diagonal of a sub matrix, replace them with the letters on the other diagonal vertices(same row exchange):

 

```

 d<--e      a --> c

  d e        a b c

  i j        f g h

  n o        k l m       k<--l

  s t       k <-- m       k l

  x y                     p q

 x-->y                   p-->q

 

 "example" encrypt to "dyckqke"

```



  - Exception 1: if two letters are in the same row or the same column, swap them:

  ```

  "ab" --> "ba"

  ```

  - Exception 2: if two letters are the same or one letter is not appear in matrix(in the `key` above is "z"), do not encrypt them:

  ```

  "aa" --> "aa"     "az" --> "az"

  ```

  - Run the function with the encrypted string, the string shoule be decrypt to the original string ;-)

  

# Some examples:



```

key=

`a b c d e

f g h i j

k l m n o

p q r s t

u v w x y`

encryption(key,"example") === "dyckqke"

encryption(key,"dyckqke") === "example"



encryption(key,"codewars") === "emeducsr"

encryption(key,"emeducsr") === "codewars"



encryption(key,"zyx") === "zyx"



```
