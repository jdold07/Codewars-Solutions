## Kata Description


# Task

`Caesar Box` is a simple transposition cipher used in the Roman Empire. It is described as the following two-step process:

```

The characters of the given message are broken into n lines

of equal lengths and stacked up;

The letters from the resulting rectangle are written from 

top to bottom column by column.```

Given a string `message`, count the number of different `n` such that the message, obtained by applying encoding two times, is the same as initial message.





# Input/Output





`[input]` string `message`



The initial message. It contains only lowercase english lettes.



`4 ‚â§ message.length ‚â§ 25.`



`[output]` an integer



The number of above-described `n`s



`1 < n < message.length.`



# Example



For `message = "abaaba"`, the output should be `2`.



It is possible to apply the encoding algorithm for `n = 2 or n = 3`.

```

For n = 2:



The first encoding: "abaaba" -> "aabbaa"

aba   ==>    aab

aba          baa

The second encoding: "aabbaa" -> "abaaba".

aab   ==>    aba

baa          aba



For n = 3:

The first encoding: "abaaba" -> "aabbaa"

ab   ==>  aa

aa        bb

ba        aa

The second encoding: "aabbaa" -> "abaaba".

aa   ==>  ab

bb        aa

aa        ba



```



For `message = "a_message"`, the output should be `1`.



It is possible to apply the encoding algorithm for `n = 3`.

```



The first encoding: "a_message" -> "aea_sgmse"

a_m   ==>    aea

ess          _sg

age          mse

The second encoding: "aea_sgmse" -> "a_message".

aea   ==>    a_m

_sg          ess

mse          age



```
