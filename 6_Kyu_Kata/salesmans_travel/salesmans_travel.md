## Kata Description


A traveling salesman has to visit clients. He got each client's address e.g. `"432 Main Long Road St. Louisville OH 43071"` as a list.



The basic zipcode format usually consists of two capital letters followed by a white space and five digits.

The list of clients to visit was given as a string of all addresses, each separated from the others by a comma, e.g. :



`"123 Main Street St. Louisville OH 43071,432 Main Long Road St. Louisville OH 43071,786 High Street Pollocksville NY 56432"`.



To ease his travel he wants to group the list by zipcode.

#### Task

The function `travel` will take two parameters `r` (addresses' list of all clients' as a string) and `zipcode` and returns a string in the following format:



`zipcode:street and town,street and town,.../house number,house number,...` 



The street numbers must be in the same order as the streets where they belong.



If a given zipcode doesn't exist in the list of clients' addresses return `"zipcode:/"`



#### Examples

```

r = "123 Main Street St. Louisville OH 43071,432 Main Long Road St. Louisville OH 43071,786 High Street Pollocksville NY 56432"



travel(r, "OH 43071") --> "OH 43071:Main Street St. Louisville,Main Long Road St. Louisville/123,432"



travel(r, "NY 56432") --> "NY 56432:High Street Pollocksville/786"



travel(r, "NY 5643") --> "NY 5643:/"

```



#### Note for Elixir:

In Elixir the empty addresses' input is an empty *list*, not an empty string.



#### Note: 

You can see a few addresses and zipcodes in the test cases.
