## Kata Description


In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients expressed with formula



```math

\lparen {n \atop k} \rparen = \frac {n!} {k!(n-k)!}

```



where `n` denotes a row of the triangle, and `k` is a position of a term in the row.

You can read [Wikipedia article on Pascal's Triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle) for more information.



### Task



Write a function that, given a depth `n`, returns `n` top rows of Pascal's Triangle flattened into a one-dimensional list/array. 



### Example:



```

n = 1: [1]

n = 2: [1,  1, 1]

n = 4: [1,  1, 1,  1, 2, 1,  1, 3, 3, 1]

```



```if-not:python,ruby

### Note



Beware of overflow. Requested terms of a triangle are guaranteed to fit into the returned type, but depending on seleced method of calculations, intermediate values can be larger.

```
