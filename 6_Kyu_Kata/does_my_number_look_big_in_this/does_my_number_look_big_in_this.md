## Kata Description


A [Narcissistic Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).



For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcisstic:

```

    1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

```

and 1652 (4 digits), which isn't:

```

    1^4 + 6^4 + 5^4 + 2^4 = 1 + 1296 + 625 + 16 = 1938

```



The Challenge:



Your code must return **true** or **false** (not 'true' and 'false') depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10. 

This may be **True** and **False** in your language, e.g. PHP. 



Error checking for text strings or other invalid inputs is not required, only valid positive non-zero integers will be passed into the function.
