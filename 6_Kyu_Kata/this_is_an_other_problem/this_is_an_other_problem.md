## Kata Description


After you've solved @**priyankaherur**'s problem ( http://www.codewars.com/kata/this-is-a-problem/javascript ) you may try to solve this other one.



## The problem:



Having created a function `NamedOne` which takes `first` & `last` names as parameters and returns an object with `firstName`, `lastName` and `fullName` ( = `firstName` + a space + `lastName` ) properties which should be all **accessibles**, we discovered that "accessible" also means "mutable".



If, for example, we've got a "NamedOne" like this :

```javascript

var namedOne = new NamedOne("Naomi","Wang")

namedOne.firstName // -> "Naomi"

namedOne.lastName  // -> "Wang"

namedOne.fullName  // -> "Naomi Wang"

```

```coffeescript

namedOne = new NamedOne("Naomi","Wang")

namedOne.firstName # -> "Naomi"

namedOne.lastName  # -> "Wang"

namedOne.fullName  # -> "Naomi Wang"

```

...properties may be **changed** :

```javascript

namedOne.firstName = "John"

namedOne.firstName // -> "John"

namedOne.lastName = "Doe"

namedOne.lastName  // -> "Doe"

```

```coffeescript

namedOne.firstName = "John"

namedOne.firstName # -> "John"

namedOne.lastName = "Doe"

namedOne.lastName  # -> "Doe"

```

...but **all** properties are not **updated** !



```javascript

namedOne.fullName  // -> "Naomi Wang" 

//-- Oh no ! we want fullName == "John Doe" now !

```

```coffeescript

namedOne.fullName  # -> "Naomi Wang" 

#-- Oh no ! we want fullName == "John Doe" now !

```



## Your mission: 



So the purpose of this kata is to create an object with accessible **and** "_updatable_" (can i say that?) properties.



* If `.firstName` or `.lastName` are changed, then `.fullName` should also be changed

* If `.fullName` is changed, then `.firstName` and `.lastName` should also be changed.



**Note** : "input format" to `.fullName` will be `firstName + space+ lastName`. If given fullName isn't valid then no property is changed.



## Examples:

```javascript

var namedOne = new NamedOne("Naomi","Wang")



namedOne.firstName = "John"

namedOne.lastName = "Doe"

// ...then...

namedOne.fullName // -> "John Doe"



// -- And :

namedOne.fullName = "Bill Smith"

// ...then...

namedOne.firstName // -> "Bill"

namedOne.lastName  // -> "Smith"



// -- But :

namedOne.fullName = "Tom" // -> no : lastName missing

namedOne.fullName = "TomDonnovan" // -> no : no space between first & last names

namedOne.fullName // -> "Bill Smith" (unchanged)

```

```coffeescript

namedOne = new NamedOne("Naomi","Wang")



namedOne.firstName = "John"

namedOne.lastName = "Doe"

# ...then...

namedOne.fullName # -> "John Doe"



# -- And :

namedOne.fullName = "Bill Smith"

# ...then...

namedOne.firstName # -> "Bill"

namedOne.lastName  # -> "Smith"



# -- But :

namedOne.fullName = "Tom" # -> no : lastName missing

namedOne.fullName = "TomDonnovan" # -> no : no space between first & last names

namedOne.fullName # -> "Bill Smith" (unchanged)

```



Can you change our function to create such a `NamedOne` object ?



(<small> **Hint**: in this kata you'll try to **define properties** of an **object**</small> )
