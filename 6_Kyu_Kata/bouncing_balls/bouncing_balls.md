## Kata Description


A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building.

The height of this floor, *h*, is known. 



He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).

 

His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.



How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling _and_ bouncing?



#### Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:



*  Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0

*  Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1

*  Float parameter "window" must be less than h.



**If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.**



#### Note:

The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly *greater* than the window parameter.



#### Examples:

```

- h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3



- h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1 



(Condition 2) not fulfilled).

```
