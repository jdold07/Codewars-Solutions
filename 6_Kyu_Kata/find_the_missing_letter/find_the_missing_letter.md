## Kata Description


# Find the missing letter



Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter in the array.



~~~if:factor

In the case of factor, your array of letters will be a string.

~~~



You will always get an valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter be missing. The length of the array will always be at least 2.<br>

The array will always contain letters in only one case.



Example:

~~~if-not:swift,factor

```

['a','b','c','d','f'] -> 'e'

['O','Q','R','S'] -> 'P'

```

~~~



~~~if:factor

```factor

"abcdf" -> CHAR: e

"OQRS" -> CHAR: P

```

~~~



```if:swift

["a","b","c","d","f"] -> "e"

["O","Q","R","S"] -> "P"

```



(Use the English alphabet with 26 letters!)
