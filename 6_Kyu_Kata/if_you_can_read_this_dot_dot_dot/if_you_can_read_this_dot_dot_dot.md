## Kata Description


The idea for this kata came from 9gag today:



[![The lyrics to "Never gonna give you up" by Rick Astley encoded in the NATO phonetic alphabet](https://9gag.com/photo/amrb4r9_700b.jpg)](http://9gag.com/gag/amrb4r9)



## Task 



You'll have to translate a string to Pilot's alphabet ([NATO phonetic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet)).



**Input:**



`If, you can read?`



**Output:**



`India Foxtrot , Yankee Oscar Uniform Charlie Alfa November Romeo Echo Alfa Delta ?`



**Note:**



* There are preloaded dictionary you can use, named `NATO`

* The set of used punctuation is `,.!?`.

* Punctuation should be kept in your return string, but spaces should not.

* __Xray__ should not have a dash within.

* Every word and punctuation mark should be seperated by a space ' '.

* There should be no trailing whitespace

<span style="color:red">Although the proper alphabet for j is </span>`Juliett`<span style="color:red"> you have to use </span>`Juliet`<span style="color:red"> here</span>

~~~if:rust

The NATO phonetic alphabet (A‚ÄìZ) is preloaded:



```rust

use preloaded::NATO;



NATO[&'R']; // Romeo

NATO[&'U']; // Uniform

NATO[&'S']; // Sierra

NATO[&'T']; // Tango

```



<details>

<summary>Click to see the preloaded code</summary>



```rust

use std::collections::HashMap;

use once_cell::sync::Lazy;



#[rustfmt::skip]

pub static NATO: Lazy<HashMap<char, &'static str>> = Lazy::new(|| {

    [

        ('A', "Alfa"), ('B', "Bravo"), ('C', "Charlie"), ('D', "Delta"),

        ('E', "Echo"), ('F', "Foxtrot"), ('G', "Golf"), ('H', "Hotel"),

        ('I', "India"), ('J', "Juliett"), ('K', "Kilo"), ('L', "Lima"),

        ('M', "Mike"), ('N', "November"), ('O', "Oscar"), ('P', "Papa"),

        ('Q', "Quebec"), ('R', "Romeo"), ('S', "Sierra"), ('T', "Tango"),

        ('U', "Uniform"), ('V', "Victor"), ('W', "Whiskey"), ('X', "Xray"),

        ('Y', "Yankee"), ('Z', "Zulu"),

    ]

    .iter()

    .copied()

    .collect()
