## Kata Description


Assume `"#"` is like a backspace in string. This means that string `"a#bc#d"` actually is `"bd"`



Your task is to process a string with `"#"` symbols.





## Examples



```

"abc#d##c"      ==>  "ac"

"abc##d######"  ==>  ""

"#######"       ==>  ""

""              ==>  ""

```
