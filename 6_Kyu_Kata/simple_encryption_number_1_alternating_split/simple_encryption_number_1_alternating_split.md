## Kata Description


Implement a pseudo-encryption algorithm which given a string `S` and an integer `N` concatenates all the odd-indexed characters of `S` with all the even-indexed characters of `S`, this process should be repeated `N` times.



Examples:



```

encrypt("012345", 1)  =>  "135024"

encrypt("012345", 2)  =>  "135024"  ->  "304152"

encrypt("012345", 3)  =>  "135024"  ->  "304152"  ->  "012345"



encrypt("01234", 1)  =>  "13024"

encrypt("01234", 2)  =>  "13024"  ->  "32104"

encrypt("01234", 3)  =>  "13024"  ->  "32104"  ->  "20314"

```



Together with the encryption function, you should also implement a decryption function which reverses the process.



If the string `S` is an empty value or the integer `N` is not positive, return the first argument without changes.
