## Kata Description


[Digital root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root) is the _recursive sum of all the digits in a number._



Given `n`, take the sum of the digits of `n`. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.



## Examples

```

    16  -->  1 + 6 = 7

   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6

132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6

493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2

```
