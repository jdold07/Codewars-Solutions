## Kata Description


The test fixture I use for this kata is pre-populated.



It will compare your guess to a random number generated using:



```ruby 

(Kernel::rand() * 100 + 1).floor

```

```javascript

Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 + 1)

```

```python

randint(1,100)

```

```php

rand(1, 100)

```



You can pass by relying on luck or skill but try not to rely on luck.



"The power to define the situation is the ultimate power." - Jerry Rubin



Good luck!
