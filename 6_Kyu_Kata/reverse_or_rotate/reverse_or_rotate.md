## Kata Description


The input is a string `str` of digits. Cut the string into chunks (a chunk here is a substring of the initial string) of size `sz` (ignore the last chunk if its size is less than `sz`).



If a chunk represents an integer such as the **sum of the cubes of its digits is divisible by 2**, reverse that chunk; 

otherwise rotate it to the left by one position.

Put together these modified chunks and return the result as a string.



If 

- `sz` is `<= 0` or if `str` is `empty` return ""

- `sz` is greater `(>)` than the length of `str` it is impossible to take a chunk of size `sz` hence return "".



#### Examples:



```

revrot("123456987654", 6) --> "234561876549"

revrot("123456987653", 6) --> "234561356789"

revrot("66443875", 4) --> "44668753"

revrot("66443875", 8) --> "64438756"

revrot("664438769", 8) --> "67834466"

revrot("123456779", 8) --> "23456771"

revrot("", 8) --> ""

revrot("123456779", 0) --> "" 

revrot("563000655734469485", 4) --> "0365065073456944"

```

```

Example of a string rotated to the left by one position:

s = "123456" gives "234561".

```
