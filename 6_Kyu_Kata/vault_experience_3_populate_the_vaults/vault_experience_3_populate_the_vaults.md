## Kata Description


**Dear Mr overseer,**





We have a big problem.



Mankind is at risk and needs to hide in underground vaults to survive. Your task: Given the number of people that can go in a vault, determine how many people should be in each category (overseers, non-overseer men, and non-overseer women).



There are several conditions that must be adhered to:



- A male overseer must always be present unless the capacity is `0`

- If more than `50` dwellers move in, the overseer must have a wife (a "second overseer")

- With an even number of dwellers, the total number of men and women should be equal

- With an odd number of dwellers, the last free spot should be occupied by a woman

- Overseers count toward the gender count



Mankind is counting on you!



Good Luck





## Examples



```

5 people   =>  1 Mr. Overseer, 3 female dwellers, 1 male dweller

51 people  =>  1 Mr. Overseer, 1 Mrs. Overseer, 25 female dwellers, 24 male dwellers

```



~~~if:csharp

Your solution should return a list of the `Dweller` class instances according to the following spec:



```

public enum Gender

{

    Mr,

    Mrs

}



public enum Position

{

    overseer,

    none

}



public class Dweller

{

    public Gender Sex { get; set; }

    public Position Work { get; set; }

    

    public Dweller() : this(Gender.Mr, Position.none) { }

    public Dweller(Gender sex) : this(sex, Position.none) { }

    public Dweller(Gender sex, Position work)

    {

        Sex = sex;

        Work = work;

    }

}

```

~~~
