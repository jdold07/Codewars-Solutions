## Kata Description


I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others. 



I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number (n)  returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.



For example:



```javascript

   nthFibo(4) == 2

```

```coffeescript

   nthFibo(4) == 2

```

```ruby

   nth_fibonacci(4) == 2

```

```haskell

   fib 4 == 2

```

```lambdacalc

   nth-fibo 4 == 2

```

```python

   nth_fib(4) == 2

```

```csharp

   NthFib(4) == 2

```

```c

   nth_fib(4) == 2

```

```julia

   nthfibo(4) == 2

```

```nasm

    mov edi, 4

    call nth_fib

    cmp rax, 2 ; should be equal

```



Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.



For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
