## Kata Description


You are provided with a skeleton of the class 'Fraction', which accepts two arguments (numerator, denominator).



EXAMPLE:

```python

fraction1 = Fraction(4, 5)

```

```csharp

Fraction fraction1 = new Fraction(4, 5);

```

```haskell

fraction1 = fraction 4 5

```

```java

Fraction fraction1 = new Fraction(4, 5);

```



Your task is to make this class string representable, and addable while keeping the result in the minimum representation possible.



EXAMPLE:

```python

print (fraction1 + Fraction(1, 8))

outputs: 37/40

```

```csharp

Console.Write(fraction1 + new Fraction(1, 8));

// Outputs: 37/40

```

```haskell

show (fraction 1 + fraction 1 8)

-- outputs: 37/40

```

```java

System.out.println(fraction1.add(new Fraction(1, 8)));

// Outputs: 37/40

```

NB:

DON'T use the built_in class 'fractions.Fraction'



Enjoy!
