## Kata Description


The drawing below gives an idea of how to cut a given "true" rectangle into squares ("true" rectangle meaning that the two dimensions are different).



![alternative text](https://i.imgur.com/lk5vJ7sm.jpg)



Can you translate this drawing into an algorithm?



You will be given two dimensions 



1. a positive integer length

2. a positive integer width



You will return a collection or a string (depending on the language; Shell bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran return a string) with the size of each of the  squares.

#### Examples in general form:

(depending on the language)

```

  sqInRect(5, 3) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]

  sqInRect(3, 5) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]

  

  You can see examples for your language in **"SAMPLE TESTS".**

```



#### Notes:

- `lng == wdth` as a starting case would be an entirely different problem and the drawing is planned to be interpreted with `lng != wdth`. (See kata, Square into Squares. Protect trees! http://www.codewars.com/kata/54eb33e5bc1a25440d000891 for this problem). 



  When the initial parameters are so that `lng` == `wdth`, the solution `[lng]` would be the most obvious but not in the spirit of this kata   so, in that case, return `None`/`nil`/`null`/`Nothing` **or**

  return `{}` with C++, `Array()` with Scala, `[]` with Perl, Raku.

 - In that case the returned structure of **C** will have its `sz` component equal to `0`. 

 - Return the string `"nil"` with Bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran.
