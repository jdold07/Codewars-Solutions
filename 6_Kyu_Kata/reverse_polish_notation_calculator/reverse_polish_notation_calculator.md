## Kata Description


Your job is to create a calculator which evaluates expressions in [Reverse Polish notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).



For example expression `5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -` (which is equivalent to `5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) - 3` in normal notation) should evaluate to `14`.



For your convenience, the input is formatted such that a space is provided between every token.



Empty expression should evaluate to `0`.



Valid operations are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.



You may assume that there won't be exceptional situations (like stack underflow or division by zero).
