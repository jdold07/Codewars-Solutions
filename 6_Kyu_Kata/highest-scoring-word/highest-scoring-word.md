## Kata Description


Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.



Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3` etc.



You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.



If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.



All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
