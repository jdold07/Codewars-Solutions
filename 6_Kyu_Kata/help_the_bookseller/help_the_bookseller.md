## Kata Description


A bookseller has lots of books classified in 26 categories labeled A, B, ... Z. 

Each book has a code `c` of 3, 4, 5 or more characters. The **1st** character of a code is a capital letter which defines the book category.

  

  In the bookseller's stocklist each code `c` is followed by a space and by a positive integer n (int n >= 0) 

  which indicates the quantity of books of this code in stock.



For example an extract of a stocklist could be:

```

L = {"ABART 20", "CDXEF 50", "BKWRK 25", "BTSQZ 89", "DRTYM 60"}.

or

L = ["ABART 20", "CDXEF 50", "BKWRK 25", "BTSQZ 89", "DRTYM 60"] or ....

```



  You will be given a stocklist (e.g. : L) and a list of categories in capital letters 

  e.g : 

```

M = {"A", "B", "C", "W"} 

or

M = ["A", "B", "C", "W"] or ...

```

  

  and your task is to find all the books of L with codes 

  belonging to each category of M and to sum their quantity according to each category. 





  For the lists L and M of example you have to return the string (in Haskell/Clojure/Racket/Prolog a list of pairs):  

  ```

  (A : 20) - (B : 114) - (C : 50) - (W : 0)

  ```  



  where A, B, C, W are the categories, 20 is the sum of the unique book of category A, 114 the sum corresponding

  to "BKWRK" and "BTSQZ", 50 corresponding to "CDXEF" and 0 to category 'W' since there are no code beginning with W.



  If L or M are empty return string is `""` (Clojure/Racket/Prolog should return an empty array/list instead).

  

#### Notes:

- In the result codes and their values are in the same order as in M.

- See "Samples Tests" for the return.
