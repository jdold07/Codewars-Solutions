## Kata Description


In this kata, you've to count lowercase letters in a given string and return the letter count in a hash with 'letter' as key and count as 'value'. The key must be 'symbol' instead of string in Ruby and 'char' instead of string in Crystal.



Example: 



```javascript

letter_count('arithmetics') //=> {"a": 1, "c": 1, "e": 1, "h": 1, "i": 2, "m": 1, "r": 1, "s": 1, "t": 2}

```

```ruby

letterCount('arithmetics') #=> {:a=>1, :c=>1, :e=>1, :h=>1, :i=>2, :m=>1, :r=>1, :s=>1, :t=>2}

```

```python

letter_count('arithmetics') #=> {"a": 1, "c": 1, "e": 1, "h": 1, "i": 2, "m": 1, "r": 1, "s": 1, "t": 2}

```

```crystal

letter_count('arithmetics') #=> {'a'=>1, :'c'=>1, 'e'=>1, 'h'=>1, 'i'=>2, 'm'=>1, 'r'=>1, 's'=>1, 't'=>2}

```
