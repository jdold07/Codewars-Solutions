## Kata Description


It is easy to join two strings together like this ```string1 + string2```.



Another way to get the desired result would be with ```string1.concat(string2)```



ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.

 

```+``` , ```.concat()``` & ```.join()``` will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!  



If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string.
