## Kata Description


You are required to create a simple calculator that returns the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of two numbers.



Your function will accept three arguments:<br>

The first and second argument should be numbers.<br>

The third argument should represent a sign indicating the operation to perform on these two numbers.

```if-not:csharp

if the variables are not numbers or the sign does not belong to the list above a message "unknown value" must be returned.

```

```if:csharp

If the sign is not a valid sign, throw an ArgumentException.

```



# Example:



```javascript

calculator(1,2,"+"); //=> result will be 3

calculator(1,2,"&"); //=> result will be "unknown value"

calculator(1,"k","*"); //=> result will be "unknown value"

```

```php

calculator(1, 2, "+"); // 3

calculator(1, 2, "&"); // "unknown value"

calculator(1, "k", "*"); // "unknown value"

```

```csharp

Kata.Calculator(1, 2, '+') => 3

Kata.Calculator(1, 2, '$') // throws ArgumentException

```

```python

calculator(1, 2, '+') => 3

calculator(1, 2, '$') # result will be "unknown value"

```



Good luck!
