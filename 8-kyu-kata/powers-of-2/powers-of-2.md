## Kata Description


Complete the function that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input, and returns a list of all the powers of `2` with the exponent ranging from `0` to `n` ( inclusive ).



## Examples



```python

n = 0  ==> [1]        # [2^0]

n = 1  ==> [1, 2]     # [2^0, 2^1]

n = 2  ==> [1, 2, 4]  # [2^0, 2^1, 2^2]

```

```bf

  n = String.fromCharCode(0)  ==> String.fromCharCode(1)

  n = String.fromCharCode(1)  ==> String.fromCharCode(1) + String.fromCharCode(2)

  n = String.fromCharCode(2)  ==> String.fromCharCode(1) + String.fromCharCode(2) + String.fromCharCode(4)

```

~~~if:lambdacalc

## Encodings



`purity: LetRec`  

`numEncoding: BinaryScott`  

export `foldr` for your `List` encoding

~~~



~~~if:riscv

RISC-V: The function signature is:



```c

void powers_of_two(size_t n, uint64_t powers[n + 1]);

```



Write the result to `powers`. You may assume it is large enough to hold the result. You should not return anything.

~~~

~~~if:bf

- Since BF doesn't have arrays, you should output each element individually.

- Outputs will always fit within a byte
