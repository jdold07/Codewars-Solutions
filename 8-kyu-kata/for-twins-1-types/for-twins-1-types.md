## Kata Description


### Prolog:



This kata series was created for friends of mine who just started to learn programming. Wish you all the best and keep your mind open and sharp!



### Task:



Write a function that will accept two parameters: `variable` and `type` and check if type of `variable` is matching `type`. Return `true` if types match or `false` if not.



### Examples:



```javascript

42, "number"   --> true

"42", "number" --> false

```



```python

42, "int"    --> True

"42", "int"  --> False

```
