## Kata Description


# SpeedCode #3 √ó Fun with ES6 Classes #5 - Dogs and Classes



## Objective



Preloaded for you is a ```class Dog```:



```javascript

class Dog {

  constructor(name, age, gender, species, size, master, loyal) {

    this.name = name;

    this.age = age;

    this.gender = gender;

    this.species = species;

    this.legs = 4;

    this.size = size;

    this.master = master;

    this.loyal = loyal;

  }

}

```



You are then given a working ```class Labrador``` as your initial code.



```javascript

class Labrador {

  constructor(name, age, gender, master) {

    this.name = name;

    this.age = age;

    this.gender = gender;

    this.species = "Labrador";

    this.legs = 4;

    this.size = "Large";

    this.master = master;

    this.loyal = true;

  }

}

```



**Shorten it so that it meets the strict character count requirements for this Kata.**



Quick, get your timer out and get ready to time yourself.  Are you ready?  Ready, get set, GO!!! :D
