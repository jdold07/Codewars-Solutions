## Kata Description


# Palindrome strings



A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. This includes capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers.



Implement a function that checks if something is a palindrome. If the input is a number, convert it to string first. 



## Examples(Input ==> Output)

```

"anna"   ==> true

"walter" ==> false

12321    ==> true

123456   ==> false

```
