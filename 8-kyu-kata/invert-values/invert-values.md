## Kata Description


Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.



~~~if-not:racket

```

invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]

invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]

invert([]) == []

```

~~~



```if:javascript,python,ruby,php,elixir,dart

You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.

```



```if:c,riscv

### Notes:

- All values are greater than `INT_MIN`

- The input should be modified, not returned.

```

~~~if:racket

```racket

(invert '(1 2 3 4 5))   ; '(-1 -2 -3 -4 -5)

(invert '(1 -2 3 -4 5)) ; '(-1 2 -3 4 -5)

(invert '())            ; '()

```

~~~



~~~if:riscv

RISC-V: The function signature is:



```c

void invert(int *arr, size_t size);

```



The input array is `arr` which contains `size` elements. Mutate the array in-place according to the above specification. You do not need to return anything.
