## Kata Description


Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".  

If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!



The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

```

name + " plays banjo" 

name + " does not play banjo"

```

Names given are always valid strings.
