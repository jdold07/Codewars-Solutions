## Kata Description


This kata is from check py.checkio.org



You are given an array with positive numbers and a non-negative number N. You should find the N-th power of the element in the array with the index N. If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first element has the index 0.



Let's look at a few examples:



~~~if-not:factor

* array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 3^2 == 9;

* array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.

~~~



~~~if:factor

* `{ 1 2 3 4 } :> array` and `2 :> n`, then the result is `3 2 ^ -> 9`;

* `{ 1 2 3 } :> array` and `3 :> n`, but N is outside of the array, so the result is `-1`.
