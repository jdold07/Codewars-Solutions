## Kata Description


You will be given an array `a` and a value `x`. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.



~~~if:swift

The type of `a` and `x` can be `String` or `Int`.

~~~

~~~if-not:swift

Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either.

~~~

~~~if:racket

In racket, you'll be given a list instead of an array. If the value is in the list,

return #t instead of another value that is also considered true.

```racket

(contains '(1 2 3) 3) ; returns #t

(contains '(1 2 3) 5) ; returns #f

```

~~~



Return `true` if the array contains the value, `false` if not.
