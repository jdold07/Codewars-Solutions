## Kata Description


## Debug celsius converter



Your friend is traveling abroad to the United States so he wrote a program to convert fahrenheit to celsius. Unfortunately his code has some bugs.



Find the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working properly.



To convert fahrenheit to celsius:

```

celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)

```

```if-not:ruby,typescript

Remember that typically temperatures in the current weather conditions are given in whole numbers. It is possible for temperature sensors to report temperatures with a higher accuracy such as to the nearest tenth. Instrument error though makes this sort of accuracy unreliable for many types of temperature measuring sensors. 

```



```if:ruby

Please round to 5dp (use `.round(5)`)

```



```if:typescript

Please round to 5dp (use `Math.round()`)

```
