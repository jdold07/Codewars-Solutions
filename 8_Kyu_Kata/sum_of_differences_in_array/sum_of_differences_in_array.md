## Kata Description


Your task is to sum the differences between consecutive pairs in the array in descending order.



## Example



```

[2, 1, 10]  -->  9

```



In descending order: `[10, 2, 1]`



Sum: `(10 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 8 + 1 = 9`



If the array is empty or the array has only one element the result should be `0` (`Nothing` in Haskell, `None` in Rust).

#### Encodings



purity: `LetRec`  

numEncoding: `BinaryScott`  

export constructors `nil, cons` for your `List` encoding
