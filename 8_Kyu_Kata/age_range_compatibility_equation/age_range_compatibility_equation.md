## Kata Description


Everybody knows the classic ["half your age plus seven"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#The_.22half-your-age-plus-seven.22_rule) dating rule that a lot of people follow (including myself). It's the 'recommended' age range in which to date someone.

```minimum age <= your age <= maximum age```

#Task



Given an integer (1 <= n <= 100) representing a person's age, return their minimum and maximum age range.



This equation doesn't work when the age <= 14, so use this equation instead:

```

min = age - 0.10 * age

max = age + 0.10 * age

```

You should floor all your answers so that an integer is given instead of a float (which doesn't represent age). ```Return your answer in the form [min]-[max]```



##Examples:



```

age = 27   =>   20-40

age = 5    =>   4-5

age = 17   =>   15-20

```
