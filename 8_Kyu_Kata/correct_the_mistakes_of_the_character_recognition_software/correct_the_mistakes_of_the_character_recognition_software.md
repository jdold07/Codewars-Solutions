## Kata Description


Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.



When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.



Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:



* `S`  is misinterpreted as `5`

* `O` is misinterpreted as `0`

* `I` is misinterpreted as `1`



The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.
