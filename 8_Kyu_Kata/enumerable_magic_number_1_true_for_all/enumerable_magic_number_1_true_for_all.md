## Kata Description


## Task

Create a method **all** which takes two params: 

* a sequence 

* a function (function pointer in C)



and returns **true** if the function in the params returns true for every element in the sequence. Otherwise, it should return false. If the sequence is empty, it should return true, since technically nothing failed the test.



## Example

```

all((1, 2, 3, 4, 5), greater_than_9) -> false

all((1, 2, 3, 4, 5), less_than_9)    -> True

```
