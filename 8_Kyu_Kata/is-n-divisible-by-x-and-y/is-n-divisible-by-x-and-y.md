## Kata Description


Create a function that checks if a number `n` is divisible by two numbers `x` **AND** `y`. All inputs are positive, non-zero numbers.



```text

Examples:

1) n =   3, x = 1, y = 3 =>  true because   3 is divisible by 1 and 3

2) n =  12, x = 2, y = 6 =>  true because  12 is divisible by 2 and 6

3) n = 100, x = 5, y = 3 => false because 100 is not divisible by 3

4) n =  12, x = 7, y = 5 => false because  12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5

```
