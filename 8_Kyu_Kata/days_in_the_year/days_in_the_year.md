## Kata Description


A variation of determining leap years, assuming only integers are used and years can be negative and positive.



Write a function which will return the days in the year and the year entered in a string.  For example:



````if:javascript

```javascript

yearDays(2000) returns "2000 has 366 days"

```

````

````if-not:javascript

```

year_days(2000) returns "2000 has 366 days"

```

````



There are a few assumptions we will accept the year 0, even though there is no year 0 in the Gregorian Calendar.



Also the basic rule for validating a leap year are as follows



Most years that can be divided evenly by 4 are leap years. 



Exception: Century years are NOT leap years UNLESS they can be evenly divided by 400.



So the years 0, -64 and 2016 will return 366 days.

Whilst 1974, -10 and 666 will return 365 days.
