## Kata Description


There are 32 letters in the Polish alphabet: 9 vowels and 23 consonants. 

 

Your task is to change the letters with diacritics:



```

ƒÖ -> a,

ƒá -> c,

ƒô -> e,

≈Ç -> l,

≈Ñ -> n,

√≥ -> o,

≈õ -> s,

≈∫ -> z,

≈º -> z

```

and print out the string without the use of the Polish letters.





For example:

```

"Jƒôdrzej B≈ÇƒÖdzi≈Ñski"  -->  "Jedrzej Bladzinski"

```
