## Kata Description


Teach snoopy and scooby doo how to bark using object methods. 

Currently only snoopy can bark and not scooby doo. 



```javascript

snoopy.bark(); // return "Woof"

scoobydoo.bark(); // undefined

```

```python

snoopy.bark() #return "Woof"

scoobydoo.bark() #undefined

```

```ruby

snoopy.bark() #return "Woof"

scoobydoo.bark() #doesn't work yet

```

Use method prototypes to enable all Dogs to bark.
