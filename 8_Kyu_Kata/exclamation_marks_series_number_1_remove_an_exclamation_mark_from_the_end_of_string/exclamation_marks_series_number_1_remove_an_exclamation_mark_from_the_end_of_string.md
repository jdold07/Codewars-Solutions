# Description:



Remove an exclamation mark from the end of a string. For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data is always a string, no need to verify it.



# Examples



```

remove("Hi!") == "Hi"

remove("Hi!!!") == "Hi!!"

remove("!Hi") == "!Hi"

remove("!Hi!") == "!Hi"

remove("Hi! Hi!") == "Hi! Hi"

remove("Hi") == "Hi"

```
