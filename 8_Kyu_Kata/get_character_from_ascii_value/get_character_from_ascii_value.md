## Kata Description


Write a function `get_char()` / `getChar()` which takes a number and returns the corresponding ASCII char for that value.



```if:c

In C, `getchar()` is an important built-in function, so the function will be named `char_of_code` to avoid confusion.

```



Example: 



```javascript

get_char(65)

```



should return:



```javascript

'A'

```
