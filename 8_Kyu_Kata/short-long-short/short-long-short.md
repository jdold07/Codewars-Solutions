## Kata Description


Given 2 strings, `a` and `b`, return a string of the form short+long+short, with the shorter string on the outside

and the longer string on the inside. The strings will not be the same length, but they may be empty ( `zero` length ).



Hint for R users:

<blockquote>The length of string is not always the same as the number of characters</blockquote>



For example: **(Input1, Input2) --> output**



```

("1", "22") --> "1221"

("22", "1") --> "1221"

```
