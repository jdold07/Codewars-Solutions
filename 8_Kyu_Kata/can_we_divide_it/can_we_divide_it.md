## Kata Description


Your task is to create the function```isDivideBy``` (or ```is_divide_by```) to check if an integer `number` is divisible by both integers `a` and `b`.



A few cases:



```



(-12, 2, -6)  ->  true

(-12, 2, -5)  ->  false



(45, 1, 6)    ->  false

(45, 5, 15)   ->  true



(4, 1, 4)     ->  true

(15, -5, 3)   ->  true



```
