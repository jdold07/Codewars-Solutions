## Kata Description


You are given the `length` and `width` of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.  

If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.



**Example(Input1, Input2 --> Output):**

```

6, 10 --> 32

3, 3 --> 9

```



**Note:** for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its `length` and `width` are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.
