## Kata Description


Create a function `close_compare` that accepts 3 parameters: `a`, `b`, and an optional `margin`. The function should return whether `a` is lower than, close to, or higher than `b`. 



`a` is considered "close to" `b` if `margin` is greater than or equal to the distance between `a` and `b`.



Please note the following:



- When `a` is close to `b`, return `0`.



Otherwise...



- When `a` is less than `b`, return `-1`.



- When `a` is greater than `b`, return `1`.



If `margin` is not given, treat it as zero.



Assume: `margin >= 0`



Tip: Some languages have a way to make parameters optional.



------



### Example 1

If `a = 3`, `b = 5`, and `margin = 3`, then `close_compare(a, b, margin)` should return `0`.



This is because `a` and `b` are no more than 3 numbers apart.



### Example 2



If `a = 3`, `b = 5`, and `margin = 0`, then `close_compare(a, b, margin)` should return `-1`. 



This is because the distance between `a` and `b` is greater than 0, and `a` is less than `b`.
