## Kata Description


You are given a method called `main`, make it print the line `Hello World!`, (yes, that includes a new line character at the end) and don't return anything



Note that for some languages, the function `main` is the entry point of the program.



Here's how it will be tested:

```java

    java Solution.class parameter1 parameter2

```    



```javascript

    Solution.main("parameter1","parameter2");

```  



```coffeescript

    Solution.main "parameter1", "parameter2","parametern"

```



```ruby

    Solution.main("parameter1", "parameter2","parametern")

```



```python

    Solution.main("parameter1", "parameter2","parametern")

```



```csharp

   Solution.Main("parameter1", "parameter2","parametern")

```



```php

   Solution::main("parameter1", "parameter2", "parametern")

```

```sh

   no extra lines there

```



```prolog

   greet:greet

```



Hints:



 1. Check your references 

 2. Think about the scope of your method

 3. For prolog you can use write but there are [better ways](https://gist.github.com/dtonhofer/20bd01f68a924912771d8405fca66a09)

 4. If you still don't get it probably you can define main as an attribute of the Solution class that accepts a single argument, and that only prints "Hello World!" without any return.
