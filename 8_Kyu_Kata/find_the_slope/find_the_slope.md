## Kata Description


Given an array of 4 integers  

```[a,b,c,d]``` representing two points ```(a, b)``` and ```(c, d)```, return a string representation of the slope of the line joining these two points. 



For an undefined slope (division by 0), return  ```undefined```  . Note that the "undefined" is case-sensitive.

```

   a:x1

   b:y1

   c:x2

   d:y2

```

   

Assume that ```[a,b,c,d]``` and the answer are all integers 

(no floating numbers!).
