## Kata Description


Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.



This function should take two arguments:

exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100);

projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);



This function should return a number (final grade).

There are four types of final grades:

- 100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.

- 90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.

- 75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.

- 0, in other cases



Examples(**Inputs**-->**Output**):

```

100, 12 --> 100

99, 0 --> 100

10, 15 --> 100



85, 5 --> 90



55, 3 --> 75



55, 0 --> 0

20, 2 --> 0

```



*Use Comparison and Logical Operators.
