## Kata Description


Given a number `n`, return the number of positive odd numbers below `n`, EASY!



### Examples (Input -> Output)

```

7  -> 3 (because odd numbers below 7 are [1, 3, 5])

15 -> 7 (because odd numbers below 15 are [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13])

```



Expect large Inputs!



~~~if:lambdacalc

Use `numEncoding BinaryScott`

~~~

~~~if:bf



**Note for Brainfuck:**



Input 5 means the input will be a character with ASCII code 5, not the character '5'. Output similarly.



The valid input range is 0 <= input <= 127, in order to avoid differences between ASCII and Unicode. You will never have to read more than one byte.
