## Kata Description


In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, `a` and `b`. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids `a` and `b`. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.



For example, if the parameters passed are `([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1])`, the volume of `a` is 12 and the volume of `b` is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.



Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

**If you can, try writing it in one line of code.**
