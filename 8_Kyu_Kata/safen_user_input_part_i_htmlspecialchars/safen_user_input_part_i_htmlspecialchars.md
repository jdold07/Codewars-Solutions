## Kata Description


# Safen User Input Part I - htmlspecialchars



You are a(n) novice/average/experienced/professional/world-famous Web Developer (choose one) who owns a(n) simple/clean/slick/beautiful/complicated/professional/business website (choose one or more) which contains form fields so visitors can send emails or leave a comment on your website with ease.  However, **with ease comes danger**.  Every now and then, a hacker visits your website and attempts to compromise it through the use of **XSS (Cross Site Scripting)**.  This is done by injecting `script` tags into the website through form fields which may contain malicious code (e.g. a redirection to a malicious website that steals personal information).



## Mission



Your mission is to implement a function that converts the following potentially harmful characters:



1. `<` --> `&lt;`

2. `>` --> `&gt;`

3. `"` --> `&quot;`

4. `&` --> `&amp;`



Good luck :D





~~~if:riscv

RISC-V: the function signature is



```c

void htmlspecialchars(const char *str, char *out);

```



`str` is the input string. Write your result to `out`. You may assume `out` is large enough to hold the result. You do not need to return anything.
