## Kata Description


Note: This kata is inspired by [Convert a Number to a String!](http://www.codewars.com/kata/convert-a-number-to-a-string/). Try that one too.



## Description



We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?



Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.



## Examples

```

"1234" --> 1234

"605"  --> 605

"1405" --> 1405

"-7" --> -7

```
