## Kata Description


Write a function that returns a string in which firstname is swapped with last name.



**Example(Input --> Output)**



```

"john McClane" --> "McClane john"

```



~~~if:riscv

RISC-V: The function signature is:



```c

char *name_shuffler(char *shuffled, const char *name);

```



`name` is the input string and `shuffled` is the output buffer you should write to. You may assume the output buffer is large enough to hold the result. Return the output buffer.
