## Kata Description


We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.



What ways of achieving this do you know?



```if:c

In C, return a dynamically allocated string that will be freed by the test suite.

```



#### Examples (input --> output):



```

123  --> "123"

999  --> "999"

-100 --> "-100"

```



~~~if:riscv

RISC-V: The function signature is:



```c

void number_to_string(int n, char *out);

```



Convert the input number `n` to a string, and write the result to `out`. You may assume `out` is large enough to hold the result. You do not need to return anything.
