## Kata Description


The goal is to create a function '`numberToPower(number, power)`' that "raises" the `number` up to `power` (*ie* multiplies `number` by itself `power` times).



### Examples

```javascript

numberToPower(3,2)  // -> 9 ( = 3 * 3 )

numberToPower(2,3)  // -> 8 ( = 2 * 2 * 2 )

numberToPower(10,6) // -> 1000000

```



**Note**: `Math.pow` and some other `Math` functions like `eval()` and `**` are disabled.
