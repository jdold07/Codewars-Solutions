## Kata Description


Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.



### Example:



```if-not:c

`["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...]` --> `["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]`

```



```if:c

~~~c

size_t length = 5;

remove_every_other(&length, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5});

// -->  {1, 3, 5}

~~~

```



None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
