## Kata Description


Complete the function that receives as input a string, and produces outputs according to the following table:



| Input | Output

| ----  | ------

| "Jabroni" | "Patron Tequila"

| "School Counselor" | "Anything with Alcohol"

| "Programmer" | "Hipster Craft Beer"

| "Bike Gang Member" | "Moonshine"

| "Politician" | "Your tax dollars"

| "Rapper" | "Cristal"

| *anything else* | "Beer"



**Note:** *anything else* is the default case: if the input to the function is not any of the values in the table, then the return value should be `"Beer"`.



Make sure you cover the cases where certain words do not show up with correct capitalization. For example, the input `"pOLitiCIaN"` should still return `"Your tax dollars"`.
