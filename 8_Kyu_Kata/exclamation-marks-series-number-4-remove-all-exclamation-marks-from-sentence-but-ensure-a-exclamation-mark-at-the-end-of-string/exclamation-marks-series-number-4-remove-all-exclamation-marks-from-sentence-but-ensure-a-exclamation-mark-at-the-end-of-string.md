## Kata Description


## Description:



Remove all exclamation marks from sentence but ensure a exclamation mark at the end of string. For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data is always a non empty string, no need to verify it.



## Examples



```

remove("Hi!") === "Hi!"

remove("Hi!!!") === "Hi!"

remove("!Hi") === "Hi!"

remove("!Hi!") === "Hi!"

remove("Hi! Hi!") === "Hi Hi!"

remove("Hi") === "Hi!"

```
