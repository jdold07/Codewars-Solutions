## Kata Description


Create a function that takes 2 integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):



Example: (**Input1, Input2 -->Output**)



```

"4",  "5" --> "9"

"34", "5" --> "39"

"", "" --> "0"

"2", "" --> "2"

"-5", "3" --> "-2"

```



Notes:

- If either input is an empty string, consider it as zero.



- Inputs and the expected output will never exceed the signed 32-bit integer limit (`2^31 - 1`)
