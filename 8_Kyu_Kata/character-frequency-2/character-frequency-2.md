## Kata Description


## Description



Welcome, Warrior! In this kata, you will get a message and you will need to get the frequency of each and every character!



## Explanation



Your function will be called `char_freq`/`charFreq`/`CharFreq` and you will get passed a string, you will then return a dictionary (object in JavaScript) with as keys the characters, and as values how many times that character is in the string. You can assume you will be given valid input. 



## Example



```python

char_freq("I like cats") // Returns {'a': 1, ' ': 2, 'c': 1, 'e': 1, 'I': 1, 'k': 1, 'l': 1, 'i': 1, 's': 1, 't': 1}

```

```javascript

charFreq("I like cats") // Returns {'a': 1, ' ': 2, 'c': 1, 'e': 1, 'I': 1, 'k': 1, 'l': 1, 'i': 1, 's': 1, 't': 1}

```

```csharp

CharFreq("I like cats") => new Dictionary<char, int> {{'a', 1}, {' ', 2}, {'c', 1}, {'e', 1}, {'I', 1}, {'k', 1}, {'l', 1}, {'i', 1}, {'s', 1}, {'t', 1}}

```
