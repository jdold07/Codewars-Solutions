## Kata Description


Given 2 elevators (named "left" and "right") in a building with 3 floors (numbered `0` to `2`), write a function `elevator` accepting 3 arguments (in order):



- `left` - The current floor of the left elevator

- `right` - The current floor of the right elevator

- `call` -  The floor that called an elevator



It should return the name of the elevator closest to the called floor (`"left"`/`"right"`).



In the case where both elevators are equally distant from the called floor, choose the elevator to the right.



You can assume that the inputs will always be valid integers between 0-2.



Examples:



```javascript

elevator(0, 1, 0); // => "left"

elevator(0, 1, 1); // => "right"

elevator(0, 1, 2); // => "right"

elevator(0, 0, 0); // => "right"

elevator(0, 2, 1); // => "right"

```

```python

elevator(0, 1, 0) # => "left"

elevator(0, 1, 1) # => "right"

elevator(0, 1, 2) # => "right"

elevator(0, 0, 0) # => "right"

elevator(0, 2, 1) # => "right"

```

```kotlin

elevator(0, 1, 0) // => "left"

elevator(0, 1, 1) // => "right"

elevator(0, 1, 2) // => "right"

elevator(0, 0, 0) // => "right"

elevator(0, 2, 1) // => "right"

```

```purescript

elevator 0 1 0 -- => "left"

elevator 0 1 1 -- => "right"

elevator 0 1 2 -- => "right"

elevator 0 0 0 -- => "right"

elevator 0 2 1 -- => "right"

```

```racket

(elevator 0 1 0) ; "left"

(elevator 0 1 1) ; "right"

(elevator 0 1 2) ; "right"

(elevator 0 0 0) ; "right"

(elevator 0 2 1) ; "right"

```
