## Kata Description


```if:python,php

In this kata you will have to write a function that takes `litres` and `price_per_litre` (**in dollar**) as arguments. 

```



```if:csharp,java,javascript

In this kata you will have to write a function that takes `litres` and `pricePerLitre` (**in dollar**) as arguments. 

```

Purchases of 2 or more litres get a discount of 5 cents per litre, purchases of 4 or more litres get a discount of 10 cents per litre, and so on every two litres, up to a maximum discount of 25 cents per litre. But total discount per litre cannot be more than 25 cents. Return the total cost rounded to 2 decimal places. Also you can guess that there will not be negative or non-numeric inputs.



Good Luck!





## Note



1 Dollar = 100 Cents
