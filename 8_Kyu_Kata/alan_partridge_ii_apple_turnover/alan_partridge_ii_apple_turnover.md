## Kata Description


# Backstory

As a treat, I'll let you read part of the script from a classic 'I'm Alan Partridge episode:

```

Lynn: Alan, there‚Äôs that teacher chap.

Alan: Michael, if he hits me, will you hit him first?

Michael: No, he‚Äôs a customer. I cannot hit customers. I‚Äôve been told. I‚Äôll go and get some stock.

Alan: Yeah, chicken stock.

Phil: Hello Alan.

Alan: Lynn, hand me an apple pie. And remove yourself from the theatre of conflict.

Lynn: What do you mean?

Alan: Go and stand by the yakults. The temperature inside this apple turnover is 1,000 degrees. If I squeeze it, a jet of molten Bramley apple is going to squirt out. Could go your way, could go mine. Either way, one of us is going down.

```

Alan is known for referring to the temperature of the apple turnover as `Hotter than the sun!`. According to  <a href="http://www.space.com/17137-how-hot-is-the-sun.html">space.com</a> the temperature of the sun's corona is 2,000,000 degrees Celsius, but we will ignore the science for now. 



# Task

Your job is simple, if `x` squared is more than 1000, return `It's hotter than the sun!!`, else, return `Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.`



**Note: Input will either be a positive integer (or a string for untyped languages).**
