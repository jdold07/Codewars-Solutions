## Kata Description


Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.



~~~if:bf

For BF all inputs end with \0, all inputs are lowercases and there is no space between.

~~~



~~~if:riscv

RISC-V: The function signature is



```c

void to_upper_case(const char *str, char *out);

```



`str` is the input string. Write your result to `out`. You may assume it is large enough to hold the result. You do not need to return anything.
