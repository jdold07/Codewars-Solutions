## Kata Description


You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening?



Write a simple function to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages.



These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before:



* hello - english

* ciao - italian

* salut - french

* hallo - german

* hola - spanish

* ahoj - czech republic

* czesc - polish



Notes



* you can assume the input is a string.

* to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word (`Hallowen` can pass the test)

* function should be case insensitive to pass the tests
