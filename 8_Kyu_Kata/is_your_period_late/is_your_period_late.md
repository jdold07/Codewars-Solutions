## Kata Description


In this kata, we will make a function to test whether a period is late.



Our function will take three parameters:



last - The Date object with the date of the last period



today - The Date object with the date of the check



cycleLength - Integer representing the length of the cycle in days





Return true if the number of days passed from last to today is greater than cycleLength. Otherwise, return false.
