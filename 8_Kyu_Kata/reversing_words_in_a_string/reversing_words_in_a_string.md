## Kata Description


You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. A word can also fit an empty string. If this is not clear enough, here are some examples:



As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.



Example (**Input** --> **Output**)



```

"Hello World" --> "World Hello"

"Hi There." --> "There. Hi"

```



Happy coding!
