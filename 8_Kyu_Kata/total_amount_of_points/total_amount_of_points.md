## Kata Description


Our football team finished the championship.

The result of each match look like "x:y". Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.



For example:

```["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]```



Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship.

Rules for counting points for each match:

- if x > y: 3 points

- if x < y: 0 point

- if x = y: 1 point



Notes:

- there are 10 matches in the championship

- 0 <= x <= 4

- 0 <= y <= 4
