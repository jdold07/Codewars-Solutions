## Kata Description


You ask a small girl,"How old are you?" She always says, "x years old", where x is a random number between 0 and 9.





Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.



Assume the test input string is always a valid string. For example, the test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old". The first character in the string is always a number.
