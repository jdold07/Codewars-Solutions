## Kata Description


~~~if:bf

Write a program which accepts a single byte `n` and then a sequence of bytes `string` and outputs the `string` exactly `n` times.



The first input byte will be `n`. Following bytes will be characters of `string`. The end of the input `string` will be indicated with a null byte `\0`.



### Examples:



"\6I" -> "IIIIII"

"\5Hello" -> "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

~~~



Write a function that accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` as parameters, and returns a string of `s` repeated exactly `n` times.



### Examples (input -> output)



```

6, "I"     -> "IIIIII"

5, "Hello" -> "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

```
