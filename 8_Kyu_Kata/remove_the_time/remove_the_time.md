## Kata Description


You're re-designing a blog and the blog's posts have the following format for showing the date and time a post was made: 



*Weekday* *Month* *Day*, *time*

e.g., 

Friday May 2, 7pm



You're running out of screen real estate, and on some pages you want to display a shorter format, *Weekday* *Month* *Day* that omits the time.



Write a function, shortenToDate, that takes the Website date/time in its original string format, and returns the shortened format.



Assume shortenToDate's input will always be a string, e.g. "Friday May 2, 7pm". Assume shortenToDate's output will be the shortened string, e.g., "Friday May 2".
