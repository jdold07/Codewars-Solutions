## Kata Description


To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:



```volume = Length * Width * Height```

    

But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side!



It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).



Return `true` if the cuboid could have equal sides, return `false` otherwise.



Return `false` for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).



Note: the sides must be **integers**
