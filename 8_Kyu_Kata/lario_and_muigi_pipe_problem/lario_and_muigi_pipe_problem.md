## Kata Description


### Issue



Looks like some hoodlum plumber and his brother has been running around and damaging your stages again.



The `pipes` connecting your level's stages together need to be fixed before you receive any more complaints.



Pipes list is correct when each `pipe` after the first index is greater (+1) than the previous one, and that there is no duplicates. 



### Task



Given the a list of `numbers`, return a fixed list so that the values increment by 1 for each index from the minimum value up to the maximum value (both included). 

  

### Example



`Input:  1,3,5,6,7,8`

`Output: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`
