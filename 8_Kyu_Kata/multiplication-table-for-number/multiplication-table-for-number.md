## Kata Description


Your goal is to return multiplication table for ```number``` that is always an integer from 1 to 10.



For example, a multiplication table (string) for ```number == 5``` looks like below:



```

1 * 5 = 5

2 * 5 = 10

3 * 5 = 15

4 * 5 = 20

5 * 5 = 25

6 * 5 = 30

7 * 5 = 35

8 * 5 = 40

9 * 5 = 45

10 * 5 = 50

```



```if-not:powershell

P. S. You can use ```\n``` in string to jump to the next line.

```



```if:powershell

P. S. You can use ``` `n ``` in string to jump to the next line. 

```



Note: newlines should be added between rows, but there should be no trailing newline at the end. If you're unsure about the format, look at the sample tests.
