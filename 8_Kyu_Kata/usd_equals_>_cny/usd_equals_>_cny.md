## Kata Description


Create a function that converts US dollars (USD) to Chinese Yuan (CNY) . The input is the amount of USD as an integer, and the output should be a string that states the amount of Yuan followed by 'Chinese Yuan'



### Examples (Input -> Output)

```

15  -> '101.25 Chinese Yuan'

465 -> '3138.75 Chinese Yuan'

```



The conversion rate you should use is 6.75 CNY for every 1 USD. All numbers should be represented as a string with 2 decimal places. (e.g. "21.00" NOT "21.0" or "21")
