## Kata Description


Create a function that finds the [integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral) of the expression passed.



In order to find the integral all you need to do is add one to the `exponent` (the second argument), and divide the `coefficient` (the first argument) by that new number.



For example for `3x^2`, the integral would be `1x^3`: we added 1 to the exponent, and divided the coefficient by that new number).



Notes:

* The output should be a string.

* The coefficient and exponent is always a positive integer.





## Examples



```

 3, 2  -->  "1x^3"

12, 5  -->  "2x^6"

20, 1  -->  "10x^2"

40, 3  -->  "10x^4"

90, 2  -->  "30x^3"

```
