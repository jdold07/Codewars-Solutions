## Kata Description


The objective of [Duck, duck, goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck,_duck,_goose) is to _walk in a circle_, tapping on each player's head until one is chosen.



----



Task:

Given an array of Player objects (an array of associative arrays in PHP) and an index (**1-based**), return the `name` of the chosen Player(`name` is a property of `Player` objects, e.g `Player.name`)



----



Example:



```

duck_duck_goose([a, b, c, d], 1) should return a.name

duck_duck_goose([a, b, c, d], 5) should return a.name

duck_duck_goose([a, b, c, d], 4) should return d.name

```

```php

// PHP only

duck_duck_goose([$a, $b, $c, $d], 1); // => $a["name"]

duck_duck_goose([$a, $b, $c, $d], 5); // => $a["name"]

duck_duck_goose([$a, $b, $c, $d], 4); // => $d["name"]

```
