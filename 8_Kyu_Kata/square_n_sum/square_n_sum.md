## Kata Description


Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.



For example, for `[1, 2, 2]` it should return `9` because `1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9`.



```if:racket

In Racket, use a list instead of an array, so '(1 2 2) should return 9.

```
