## Kata Description


For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. If the input is a string then "Zach" ate the cookie. If the input is a float or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. If the input is anything else "the dog" ate the cookie. The way to return the statement is:

"Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!"



Ex: Input = "hi" --> Output = "Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach!

(The reason you return Zach is because the input is a string)



Note: Make sure you return the correct message with correct spaces and punctuation.



Please leave feedback for this kata.

Cheers!
