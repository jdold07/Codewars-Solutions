## Kata Description


Write a function that calculates the original product price, without VAT.



## Example

If a product price is `200.00` and VAT is `15%`, then the final product price (with VAT) is: `200.00 + 15% = 230.00`



Thus, if your function receives `230.00` as input, it should return `200.00`



**Notes:** 



* VAT is *always* `15%` for the purposes of this Kata.

* Round the result to 2 decimal places.

* If `null` value given then return `-1`
