## Kata Description


Hey Codewarrior! 



You already implemented a <b>Cube</b> class, but now we need your help again! I'm talking about constructors. We don't have one. Let's code two: One taking an integer and one handling no given arguments!





Also we got a problem with negative values. Correct the code so negative values will be switched to positive ones!



The constructor taking no arguments should assign 0 to Cube's Side property.
