## Kata Description


# Summation



Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.



For example:

```if-not:racket

~~~

summation(2) -> 3

1 + 2



summation(8) -> 36

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

~~~

```

```if:racket

~~~racket

(summation 2) ; 3  (+ 1 2)

(summation 8) ; 36 (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)

~~~

```
