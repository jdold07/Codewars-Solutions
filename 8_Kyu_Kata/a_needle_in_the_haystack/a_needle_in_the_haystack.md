## Kata Description


Can you find the needle in the haystack?



Write a function `findNeedle()` that takes an `array` full of junk but containing one `"needle"`



After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:



`"found the needle at position "` plus the `index` it found the needle, so: 



**Example(Input --> Output)**

```

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 

```



**Note: In COBOL, it should return** `"found the needle at position 6"`
