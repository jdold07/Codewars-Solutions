## Kata Description


Create a class `Ball`. Ball objects should accept one argument for "ball type" when instantiated.



If no arguments are given, ball objects should instantiate with a "ball type" of "regular."



```javascript

ball1 = new Ball();

ball2 = new Ball("super");



ball1.ballType     //=> "regular"

ball2.ballType     //=> "super"

```

```coffeescript

ball1 = new Ball()

ball2 = new Ball("super")

ball1.ballType #=> "regular"

ball2.ballType #=> "super"

```

```ruby

ball1 = Ball.new

ball2 = Ball.new "super"

ball1.ball_type  #=> "regular"

ball2.ball_type  #=> "super"

```

```python

ball1 = Ball()

ball2 = Ball("super")

ball1.ball_type  #=> "regular"

ball2.ball_type  #=> "super"

```

```scala

ball1 = new Ball();

ball2 = new Ball("super");



ball1.ballType     //=> "regular"

ball2.ballType     //=> "super"

```
