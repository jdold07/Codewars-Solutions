## Kata Description


Given an list `r`, return how long it would take a tunnel boring machine to excavate a tunnel through `r`.



`r` is a list that contain the following values or different combinations of the following values:

- Very hard rock `[]`: takes 60 minutes to excavate

- Hard Rock `{}`: takes 50 minutes to excavate 

- Somewhat Hard Rock `()`: takes 40 minutes to excavate

- Somewhat Soft Rock `||`: takes 30 minutes to excavate

- Soft Rock `::`: takes 20 minutes to excavate



After every 3 sections it excavates, the machine needs to stop for 30 minutes so workers could remove the excavated rock. 



# Notes: 

- The returned time should be in minutes

- 'r' may contain values with only one half. Example: `[` should equal 30

- 'r' may also contain empty strings. Example: `"  "` should equal 0





# Examples

```python

tunnel_digging(['|)', '{ ', '{ ', '|]', '{ ', ' }']) # returns 240

tunnel_digging(['( ', '()', '(}', '[]', '{ ', '{ ']) # returns 275

tunnel_digging(['  ', '{ ', '[ ', '[)', '[}']) # returns 190

tunnel_digging(['{ ', ' }', '[}', ': ', '[ ', ':|']) # returns 230

```
