## Kata Description


Write a program that will calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a given number.



`N! = 1 * 2 * 3 *  ... * N`



Be careful `1000!` has 2568 digits...



For more info, see: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Factorial.html 



## Examples



```python

zeros(6) = 1

# 6! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 720 --> 1 trailing zero



zeros(12) = 2

# 12! = 479001600 --> 2 trailing zeros

```



*Hint: You're not meant to calculate the factorial. Find another way to find the number of zeros.*
