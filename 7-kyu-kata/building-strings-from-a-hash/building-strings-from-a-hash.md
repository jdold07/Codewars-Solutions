## Kata Description


Complete the solution so that it takes the object (JavaScript/CoffeeScript) or hash (ruby) passed in and generates a human readable string from its key/value pairs. 



The format should be "KEY = VALUE". Each key/value pair should be separated by a comma except for the last pair.



**Example:**

```javascript

solution({a: 1, b: '2'}) // should return "a = 1,b = 2"

```

```coffeescript

solution({a: 1, b: '2'}) # should return "a = 1,b = 2"

```

```ruby

solution({"a" => 1, "b" => '2'}) # should return "a = 1,b = 2"

```

```csharp

Kata.StringifyDict(new Dictionary<char, int> {{'a', 1}, {'b', 2}}) => "a = 1,b = 2";

```

```fsharp

let dict = [

    'a',1

] |> dict

let dictionary = new Dictionary<char,int>(dict)

solution dictionary == "a = 1"

```

```python

solution({"a": 1, "b": '2'}) # should return "a = 1,b = 2"

```
