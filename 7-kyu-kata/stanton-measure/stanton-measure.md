## Kata Description


The `Stanton` measure of an array is computed as follows: count the number of occurences for value `1` in the array. Let this count be `n`. The `Stanton` measure is the number of times that `n` appears in the array. 



Write a function which takes an integer array and returns its `Stanton` measure.



#### Examples

The Stanton measure of `[1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2]` is `3`, because `1` occurs `2` times in the array and `2` occurs `3` times.



The Stanton measure of `[1, 4, 1, 2, 11, 2, 3, 1]` is `1`, because `1` occurs `3` times in the array and `3` occurs `1` time.
