## Kata Description


# Fun with ES6 Classes #3 - Cuboids, Cubes and Getters



## Task



Define the following classes.



### I. Cuboid



The object ```constructor``` for the ```class Cuboid``` should receive exactly three arguments in the following order: ```length, width, height``` and store these three values in ```this.length```, ```this.width``` and ```this.height``` respectively.



The ```class Cuboid``` should then have a **getter** ```surfaceArea``` which returns the surface area of the cuboid and a getter ```volume``` which returns the volume of the cuboid.



### II. Cube



```class Cube``` is a subclass of ```class Cuboid```.  The ```constructor``` function of ```Cube``` should receive one argument only, its ```length```, and use that value passed in to set ```this.length```, ```this.width``` and ```this.height```.



*Hint: Make a call to ```super```, passing in the correct arguments, to make life easier ;)*
