## Kata Description


It's based on [this kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/area-or-perimeter). It's suggested that you solve that kata first.



# Task



You are given the length and width of a 4 sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square. 



Your job is to check if it is a square then return the area. If it is a rectangle then return its perimeter.



```javascript

Test.assertEquals(area_or_perimeter(6 , 10) , 32);

```

 



# Note



Note : For the purposes of Kata you will assume that it is a square when lengths are equal otehrwise it is a rectangle.



# Code Limit



 code.length < `39` characters.

 

 Advice: if your code length is much longer than the limit, giving up is also a good choice :D
