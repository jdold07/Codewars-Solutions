## Kata Description


Your task is to add a new property ```usersAnswer``` to every object in the array ```questions```. The value of ```usersAnswer``` should be set to ```null```. The solution should work for array of any length. 



For example: 



```javascript 

var questions = [{

    question: "What's the currency of the USA?",

    choices: ["US dollar", "Ruble", "Horses", "Gold"],

    corAnswer: 0

}, {

    question: "Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?",

    choices: ["Philadelphia", "At the bottom", "Frankie's Pub", "China"],

    corAnswer: 0

}];

```     



After adding the property the result should be:

```javascript

var questions = [{

    question: "What's the currency of the USA?",

    choices: ["US dollar", "Ruble", "Horses", "Gold"],

    corAnswer: 0,

    usersAnswer: null

}, {

    question: "Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?",

    choices: ["Philadelphia", "At the bottom", "Frankie's pub", "China"],

    corAnswer: 0,

    usersAnswer: null

}];

``` 

    

    

The `questions` array is already defined for you and is not the same as the one in the example.
