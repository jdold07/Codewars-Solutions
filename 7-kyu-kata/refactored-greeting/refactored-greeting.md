## Kata Description


The following code could use a bit of object-oriented artistry. While it's a simple method and works just fine as it is, in a larger system it's best to organize methods into classes/objects. (Or, at least, something similar depending on your language)



Refactor the following code so that it belongs to a Person class/object. Each Person instance will have a greet method. The Person instance should be instantiated with a name so that it no longer has to be passed into each greet method call. 



Here is how the final refactored code would be used:



```javascript

var joe = new Person('Joe');

joe.greet('Kate'); // should return 'Hello Kate, my name is Joe'

joe.name           // should == 'Joe'

```

```coffeescript

joe = new Person('Joe')

joe.greet('Kate') # should return 'Hello Kate, my name is Joe'

joe.name          # should == 'Joe'

```

```ruby

joe = Person.new('Joe')

joe.greet('Kate') # should return 'Hello Kate, my name is Joe'

joe.name          # should == 'Joe'

```

```rust

let joe = Person::new("Joe");

joe.greet("Kate"); // should return "Hello Kate, my name is Joe"

joe.name;          // should == "Joe"

```

```python

joe = Person('Joe')

joe.greet('Kate') # should return 'Hello Kate, my name is Joe'

joe.name          # should == 'Joe'

```
