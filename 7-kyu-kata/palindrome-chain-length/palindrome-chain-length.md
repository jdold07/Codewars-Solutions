## Kata Description


Number is a palindrome if it is equal to the number with digits in reversed order.

For example, `5`, `44`, `171`, `4884` are palindromes, and `43`, `194`, `4773` are not.



Write a function which takes a positive integer and returns the number of special steps needed to obtain a palindrome. The special step is: "reverse the digits, and add to the original number". If the resulting number is not a palindrome, repeat the procedure with the sum until the resulting number is a palindrome.



If the input number is already a palindrome, the number of steps is `0`.



~~~if:java

All inputs are guaranteed to have a final palindrome which does not overflow `long`.

~~~

~~~if:javascript

All inputs are guaranteed to have a final palindrome which does not overflow `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.

~~~

~~~if:python

All inputs are guaranteed to have a final palindrome smaller than `$ 2^63 $`.

~~~

~~~if:pascal

All inputs are guaranteed to have a final palindrome which does not overflow `integer`.

~~~





### Example



For example, start with `87`:



```

  87 +   78 =  165     - step 1, not a palindrome

 165 +  561 =  726     - step 2, not a palindrome

 726 +  627 = 1353     - step 3, not a palindrome

1353 + 3531 = 4884     - step 4, palindrome!

```



`4884` is a palindrome and we needed `4` steps to obtain it, so answer for `87` is `4`.
