## Kata Description


# Story



Your online store likes to give out coupons for special occasions. Some customers try to cheat the system by entering invalid codes or using expired coupons.



# Task



Your mission:  

Write a function called `checkCoupon` which verifies that a coupon code is valid and not expired.



A coupon is no more valid on the day **AFTER** the expiration date.  All dates will be passed as strings in this format: `"MONTH DATE, YEAR"`.



## Examples:



```javascript

checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 9, 2015")  ===  true

checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 2, 2015")  ===  false

```

```typescript

checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 9, 2015")  ===  true

checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 2, 2015")  ===  false

```

```csharp

CheckCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 9, 2015")  ==  true

CheckCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 2, 2015")  ==  false

```

```python

checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 9, 2015")  == True

checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 2, 2015")  == False

```
