## Kata Description


Given 2 strings, `a` and `b`, return a string of the form: `shorter+reverse(longer)+shorter.`





In other words, the shortest string has to be put as prefix and as suffix of the reverse of the longest.



Strings `a` and `b` may be empty, but not null (In C# strings may also be null. Treat them as if they are empty.).  

If `a` and `b` have the same length treat `a` as the longer producing `b+reverse(a)+b`
