## Kata Description


In this kata, you'll be given an integer of range `0 <= x <= 99` and have to return that number spelt out in English. A few examples:



```java

nameThatNumber(4)  // returns "four"

nameThatNumber(19) // returns "nineteen"

nameThatNumber(99) // returns "ninety nine"

```



```python

name_that_number(4)   # returns "four"

name_that_number(19)  # returns "nineteen"

name_that_number(99)  # returns "ninety nine"

```



```javascript

nameThatNumber(4)   // returns "four"

nameThatNumber(19)  // returns "nineteen"

nameThatNumber(99)  // returns "ninety nine"

```



Words should be separated by only spaces and not hyphens. No need to validate parameters, they will always be in the range [0, 99]. Make sure that the returned String has no leading of trailing spaces. Good luck!
