## Kata Description


You will get a list with several scattered numbers



You must check that the sum of the two values on both sides equals the sum of the rest of the list elements



And if not, delete the two elements on the sides and check repeatedly,



until you reach the condition checklist:



The sum of the list without the sides = the sum of the sides



If it never equals return an empty list []



`note: list length can be up to 500 items`



# Example:

Ex1:

```python

[1,2,3,4,5] ==> 1+5 != 2+3+4 ==> [2,3,4] ==> 2+4 != 3 == [3] ==> 3+3 != 0 ==> []

```

note: (3+3) because 3 is first side and last side... (!= 0) because sum of list without sides = 0





Ex2:

```python

[0,104,3,101,0,111] ==> 0+111 != 104+3+101+0 ==> [104,3,101,0] ==> 104+0 = 3+101 ==> [104,3,101,0]

```





Ex3:

```python

[1,-1] ==> 1-1 = 0 ==> [1,-1]

```

note: (1-1) because 1 is first side and -1 is last side... (= 0) because sum of list without sides (1, -1) = 0
