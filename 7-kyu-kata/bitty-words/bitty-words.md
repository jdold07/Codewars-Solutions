## Kata Description


Your friend has given you a secret message nested inside a block of text. She provided you the key to her code as a number and now you must decode the message.



The number, in binary, represents on/off flags for each word of the phrase. The bit order, overlayed on the array of words, will give which words to include in the phrase.

```

Example:

bittyWords('Long live the king', 11)

Convert to binary: 11 = 0b1011

Apply binary to words list:

['Long', 'live', 'the', 'king']

    1       0      1       1

result: 'Long the king'

```

If the number does not have enough bits for the words array, left pad the number with 0s.



Example:

```

bittyWords('So long and thanks for all the fish', 42) === 'and for the'

```

42 is 0b101010 which is only 6 words, but the phrase has 8 words. The left two words are 0s and not included in the output.



To uncomplicate things, there will be no punctuation in the phrases.
