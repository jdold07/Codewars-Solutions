## Kata Description


Due to another of his misbehaved, 

the primary school's teacher of the young Gau√ü,  Herr J.G. B√ºttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates,

assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number `n`.



Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.



Here's, an example:



```

f(n=100) // returns 5050 

```



It's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, please, return false (None for Python, null for C#, 0 for COBOL).



> **Note:** the goal of this kata is to invite you to think about some 'basic' mathematic formula and how you can do performance optimization on your code. 



> Advanced - experienced users should try to solve it in one line, without loops, or optimizing the code as much as they can.

**Credits:** this kata was inspired by the farzher's kata <a href="http://www.codewars.com/kata/54c2fc0552791928c9000517">'Sum of large ints' </a>. In fact, it can be seen as a sort of prep kata for that one.
