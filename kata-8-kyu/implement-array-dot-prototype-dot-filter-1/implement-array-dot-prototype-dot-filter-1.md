## Kata Description


What we want to implement is **`Array.prototype.filter()`** function, just like the existing `Array.prototype.filter()`. Another similar function is `_.filter()` in underscore.js and lodash.js. 



The usage will be quite simple, like:

```

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].filter(num => num > 3) == [4, 5]

```



*Of course, the existing `Array.prototype.filter()` function has been undefined for the purposes of this Kata.*
