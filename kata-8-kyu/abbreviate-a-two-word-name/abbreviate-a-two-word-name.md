## Kata Description


Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.



The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.



It should look like this:



`Sam Harris` => `S.H`



`patrick feeney` => `P.F`



~~~if:riscv

RISC-V: The function signature is:



```c

char *get_initials(const char *full_name, char initials[4]);

```



Write your result to `initials`, and return that buffer.
