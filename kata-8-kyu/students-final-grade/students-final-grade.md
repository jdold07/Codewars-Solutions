## Kata Description


Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.



This function should take two arguments:

exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100);

projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);



This function should return a number (final grade).

There are four types of final grades:

- 100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.

- 90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.

- 75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.

- 0, in other cases



Examples(**Inputs**-->**Output**):

```

100, 12 --> 100

99, 0 --> 100

10, 15 --> 100



85, 5 --> 90



55, 3 --> 75



55, 0 --> 0

20, 2 --> 0

```



*Use Comparison and Logical Operators.

###### *This Kata description was compiled by [**JDOld07**](https://tpstech.dev) with data provided by the [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com) API.*

###### *The solutions in each language code file associated with this kata are my solutions unless otherwise noted in the code file.  Test cases are most often verbatim of those provided by the Kata.  However, in some cases it has been necessary to modify the test cases in order to have them function with my test runners and in my local environment.  On occasion, I may have added additional test cases to those provided.  Also, though I can't recall an instance, there may potentially have been reason to remove test cases for functional reasons.  Some Kata's also require (*or have*) code preloaded for their operation.  This code is included if it was required to make the tests work.  It is clearly identified under a **PRELOAD CODE** header if included.*

###### Most of my solutions are not commented (*though this will hopefully change*) as solutions are rarely submitted with comments on [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com).*
