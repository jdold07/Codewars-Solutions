## Kata Description


# Fun with ES6 Classes #1 - People, people, people



Time for some OOP fun!



Define a ```class Person``` with the following properties:



 - A `constructor` that accepts 4 arguments: `firstName`/`FirstName` (defaults to `"John"` if not set), `lastName`/`LastName` (defaults to `"Doe"` if not set), `age`/`Age` (defaults to `0` if not set) and `gender`/`Gender` (defaults to `"Male"` if not set).  These should be stored in `this.firstName`/`this.FirstName`, `this.lastName`/`this.LastName`, `this.age`/`this.Age` and `this.gender`/`this.Gender` respectively.

 - A method `sayFullName`/`SayFullName` that accepts no arguments and returns the full name (e.g. `"John Doe"`)

 - A class/static method `greetExtraTerrestrials`/`GreetExtraTerrestrials` that accepts one parameter `raceName` and returns `"Welcome to Planet Earth raceName"`.  For example, if the race name is "Martians", it should say `"Welcome to Planet Earth Martians"`



You may use any valid syntax you like; however, it is **highly recommended that you complete this Kata using ES6 syntax and features**.



Have fun! :D
