## Kata Description

Ahoy matey!

You are a leader of a small pirate crew. And you have a plan.

With the help of OOP you wish to make a pretty efficient system to identify ships with a heavy booty on board.

Unfortunattely for you, people weigh a lot this days, so how do you know if a ship if full of gold and not people?

You begin with writing a generic Ship class / struct:

```javascript
function Ship(draft, crew) {
  this.draft = draft

  this.crew = crew
}
```

```python

class Ship:

    def __init__(self, draft, crew):

        self.draft = draft

        self.crew = crew

```

```csharp

public class Ship

{

  public int Draft;

  public int Crew;



  public Ship(int draft, int crew)

  {

    Draft = draft;

    Crew = crew;

  }

}

```

```rust

struct Ship {

  draft: u32,

  crew: u32,

}

```

Every time your spies see a new ship enter the dock, they will create a new ship object based on their observations:

- draft - an estimate of the ship's weight based on how low it is in the water

- crew - the count of crew on board

```javascript
let titanic = new Ship(15, 10)
```

```python

Titanic = Ship(15, 10)

```

```csharp

Ship titanic = new Ship(15, 10);

```

```rust

  let titanic = Ship {

      draft : 15,

      crew : 10,

  };

```

Taking into account that an average crew member on board adds `1.5` units to the draft, a ship that has a draft of more than `20` without crew is considered worthy to loot. Any ship weighing that much must have a lot of booty!

Add the method

```javascript
isWorthIt
```

```python

is_worth_it

```

```rust

is_worth_it(&self)

```

```csharp

IsWorthIt

```

to decide if the ship is worthy to loot. For example:

```javascript
titanic.isWorthIt() // return false
```

```python

Titanic.is_worth_it()

False

```

```csharp

titanic.IsWorthIt() => false

```

```rust

titanic.is_worth_it() -> false

```

This Kata teaches you the very basic of method creation.

Good luck!
