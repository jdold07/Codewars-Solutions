## Kata Description


## Task



Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).



The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.



Mind the input validation.



## Example



    { 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16

    { 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6



## Input validation



If an empty value ( `null`, `None`, `Nothing` etc. ) is given instead of an array, or the given array is an empty list or a list with only `1` element, return `0`.
