## Kata Description


An NBA game runs 48 minutes (Four 12 minute quarters). Players do not typically play the full game, subbing in and out as necessary. Your job is to extrapolate a player's points per game if they played the full 48 minutes.



Write a function that takes two arguments, ppg (points per game) and mpg (minutes per game) and returns a straight extrapolation of ppg per 48 minutes rounded to the nearest tenth. Return 0 if 0.



Examples:

```javascript

pointsPer48(12, 20) // 28.8

pointsPer48(10, 10) // 48 

pointsPer48(5, 17) // 14.1 

pointsPer48(0, 0) // 0

```

```python

nba_extrap(12, 20) # 28.8

nba_extrap(10, 10) # 48

nba_extrap(5, 17) # 14.1

nba_extrap(0, 0) # 0

```

```csharp

Kata.NbaExtrap(12, 20) => 28.8

Kata.NbaExtrap(10, 10) => 48

Kata.NbaExtrap(5, 17)  => 14.1

Kata.NbaExtrap(0, 0)   => 0

```

```ruby

nba_extrap(12, 20) # 28.8

nba_extrap(10, 10) # 48

nba_extrap(5, 17) # 14.1

nba_extrap(0, 0) # 0

```



Notes:<br>

All inputs will be either be an integer or float.<br>

Follow your dreams!
