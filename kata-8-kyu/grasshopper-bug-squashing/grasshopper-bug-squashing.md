## Kata Description


## Terminal game bug squashing



You are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game. In the board game, each turn has six steps that must happen in this order: roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more health, and print status.



---



You are using a library that already has the functions below. Create a function named `main` that calls the functions in the proper order.



```javascript

- combat

- buyHealth

- getCoins

- printStatus

- rollDice

- move

```

```ruby

- `combat`

- `buy_health`

- `get_coins`

- `print_status`

- `roll_dice`

- `move`

```

```python

- `combat`

- `buy_health`

- `get_coins`

- `print_status`

- `roll_dice`

- `move`

```

```csharp

- `Combat`

- `BuyHealth`

- `GetCoins`

- `PrintStatus`

- `RollDice`

- `Move`

```
