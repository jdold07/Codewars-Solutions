## Kata Description


## If/else syntax debug



While making a game, your partner, Greg, decided to create a function to check if the user is still alive called `checkAlive`/`CheckAlive`/`check_alive`. Unfortunately, Greg made some errors while creating the function.



`checkAlive`/`CheckAlive`/`check_alive` should return true if the player's health is greater than 0 or false if it is 0 or below. 



```if-not:csharp

The function receives one parameter `health` which will always be a whole number between -10 and 10.

```
