## Kata Description


This function should test if the `factor` is a factor of `base`.



Return `true` if it is a factor or `false` if it is not.



## About factors

Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get another number.



2 and 3 are factors of 6 because: `2 * 3 = 6`



- You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the number is a factor.

- You can use the mod operator (`%`) in most languages to check for a remainder



For example 2 is not a factor of 7 because: `7 % 2 = 1`



Note: `base` is a non-negative number, `factor` is a positive number.
