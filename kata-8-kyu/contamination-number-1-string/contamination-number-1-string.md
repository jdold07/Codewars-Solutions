## Kata Description


An AI has infected a text with a character!! 



This text is now **fully mutated** to this character.



~~~if-not:riscv

If the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.  

There will never be a case when both are empty as nothing is going on!!



**Note:** The character is a string of length 1 or an empty string.

~~~



~~~if:riscv

If the text is empty, return an empty string.

~~~



# Example



```

text before = "abc"

character   = "z"

text after  = "zzz"

```



~~~if:riscv

RISC-V: The function signature is



```c

void contamination(const char *text, char mutation, char *result);

```



The function does not have a return value - you should write the mutated string into `result`. You may safely assume that `result` will be large enough to hold the result.
