## Kata Description


## Task:



Write a function that accepts two integers and returns the remainder of dividing the larger value by the smaller value.



```if:cobol

Divison by zero should return `-1`. 

```



```if:csharp

Divison by zero should throw a `DivideByZeroException`. 

```



```if:coffeescript,javascript

Division by zero should return `NaN`.

```



```if:php,python,ruby

Division by zero should return an empty value.

```



### Examples:



```

n = 17

m = 5

result = 2 (remainder of `17 / 5`)



n = 13

m = 72

result = 7 (remainder of `72 / 13`)



n = 0

m = -1

result = 0 (remainder of `0 / -1`)



n = 0

m = 1

result - division by zero (refer to the specifications on how to handle this in your language)

```
