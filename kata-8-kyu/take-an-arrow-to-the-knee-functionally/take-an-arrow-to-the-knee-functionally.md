## Kata Description


<h1>Arrow style Functions</h1>

Come here to practice the Arrow style functions 

Not much else to say good luck!



<h2>Details</h2>



You will be given an array of numbers which can be used using the ```String.fromCharCode()``` (JS), ```Tools.FromCharCode()```  (C#) method to convert the number to a character. It is recommended to map over the array of numbers and convert each number to the corresponding ascii character.





<h3>Examples</h3>



These are example of how to convert a number to an ascii Character:<br>

Javascript => `String.fromCharCode(97) // a`

<br>

C# => `Tools.FromCharCode(97) // a`
