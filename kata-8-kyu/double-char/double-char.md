## Kata Description


Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.



### Examples (Input -> Output):

```

* "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"

* "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"

* "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "

```

Good Luck!



~~~if:riscv

RISC-V: The function signature is



```c

char *double_char(const char *string, char *doubled);

```



Write your result to `doubled`. You may assume it is large enough to hold the result. Return `doubled` when you are done.
