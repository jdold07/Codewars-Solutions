## Kata Description


The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).



For example:

```



Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.
