## Kata Description


Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first `n` multiples of `x`. 



Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than `0`. 



Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).



### Examples



```cpp

countBy(1,10)  should return  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}

countBy(2,5)  should return {2,4,6,8,10}

```

```java

countBy(1,10)  // should return  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}

countBy(2,5)  // should return {2,4,6,8,10}

```

```javascript

countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```nasm

mov rdi, .memory ; {,,,,,,,,}

mov esi, 1

mov rdx, 10

call cntbyx     ; [RAX] <- {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}



mov rdi, .memory  ; {,,,,}

mov esi 2

mov rdx, 5

call cntbyx     ; [RAX] <- {2,4,6,8,10}

```

```coffeescript

countBy(1,10) == [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

countBy(2,5) == [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```dart

countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```coffeescript

countBy(1,10) == [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

countBy(2,5) == [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```python

count_by(1,10) #should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

count_by(2,5) #should return [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```ruby

count_by(1,10) #should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

count_by(2,5) #should return [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```crystal

count_by(1,10) #should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

count_by(2,5) #should return [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```julia

countby(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

countby(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```r

count_by(1,10) #should return c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

count_by(2,5) #should return c(2,4,6,8,10)

```

```haskell

countBy 1 10 `shouldBe` [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

countBy 2  5 `shouldBe` [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```lambdacalc

count-by 1 10 -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

count-by 2  5 -> [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```elixir

count_by(1, 10) == [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

count_by(2, 5) == [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```solidity

countBy(1,10) // should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

countBy(2,5) // should return [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```php

countBy(1,10) // should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

countBy(2,5) // should return [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```groovy

Kata.countBy(1, 10) == [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

Kata.countBy(2, 5) == [2,4,6,8,10]

```

```racket

(count-by 1 10) ; returns '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)

(count-by 2 5)  ; returns '(2 4 6 8 10)

```

```rust

count_by(1, 10) // should return vec![1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

count_by(2,5) // should return vec![2,4,6,8,10]

```
