## Kata Description


Imagine you are creating a game where the user has to guess the correct number. But there is a limit of how many guesses the user can do.



- If the user tries to guess more than the limit, the function should throw an error.

- If the user guess is right it should return true.

- If the user guess is wrong it should return false and lose a life.



Can you finish the game so all the rules are met?
