## Kata Description


We want an array, but not just any old array, an array with contents!



Write a function that produces an array with the numbers `0` to `N-1` in it.



For example, the following code will result in an array containing the numbers `0` to `4`:



```

arr(5) // => [0,1,2,3,4]

```

Note: The parameter is optional. So you have to give it a default value.
