## Kata Description


This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.



`Point` objects have `x` and `y` attributes (`X` and `Y` in `C#`) attributes.



Write a function calculating distance between `Point a` and `Point b`.



Tests round answers to 6 decimal places.
