## Kata Description


Clock shows `h` hours, `m` minutes and `s` seconds after midnight.



Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.



## Example:



```

h = 0

m = 1

s = 1



result = 61000

```



Input constraints:



* `0 <= h <= 23`

* `0 <= m <= 59`

* `0 <= s <= 59`



~~~if:riscv

RISC-V: The function signature is:



```c

int past(int h, int m, int s);

```
