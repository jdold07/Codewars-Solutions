## Kata Description

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/13AN8X7jBIm15m/giphy.gif" style="width:463px;height:200px;">

Every budding hacker needs an alias! `The Phantom Phreak`, `Acid Burn`, `Zero Cool` and `Crash Override` are some notable examples from the film `Hackers`.

Your task is to create a function that, given a proper first and last name, will return the correct alias.

#### Notes:

- Two objects that return a one word name in response to the first letter of the first name and one for the first letter of the surname are already given.

- If the first character of either of the names given to the function is not a letter from `A - Z`, you should return `"Your name must start with a letter from A - Z."`

- Sometimes people might forget to capitalize the first letter of their name so your function should accommodate for these grammatical errors.

## Examples

```javascript

let firstName = {A: 'Alpha', B: 'Beta', C: 'Cache' ...}

let surname = {A: 'Analogue', B: 'Bomb', C: 'Catalyst' ...}



aliasGen('Larry', 'Brentwood') === 'Logic Bomb'

aliasGen('123abc', 'Petrovic') === 'Your name must start with a letter from A - Z.'

```

```python

FIRST_NAME = {'A': 'Alpha', 'B': 'Beta', 'C': 'Cache', ...}

SURNAME = {'A': 'Analogue', 'B': 'Bomb', 'C': 'Catalyst' ...}



alias_gen('Larry', 'Brentwood') == 'Logic Bomb'

alias_gen('123abc', 'Petrovic') == 'Your name must start with a letter from A - Z.'

```

```ruby

FIRST_NAME = {'A': 'Alpha', 'B': 'Beta', 'C': 'Cache', ...}

SURNAME = {'A': 'Analogue', 'B': 'Bomb', 'C': 'Catalyst' ...}



alias_gen('Larry', 'Brentwood') == 'Logic Bomb'

alias_gen('123abc', 'Petrovic') == 'Your name must start with a letter from A - Z.'

```

```csharp

FirstName = {{"A", "Alpha"}, {"B", "Beta"}, {"C", "Cache"}, ...}

Surname = {{"A", "Analogue"}, {"B", "Bomb"}, {"C", "Catalyst"} ...}



// These dictionaries are defined on other partial Kata class



AliasGen('Larry', 'Brentwood') == 'Logic Bomb'

AliasGen('123abc', 'Petrovic') == 'Your name must start with a letter from A - Z.'

```

Happy hacking!
