## Kata Description


You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will cost you. Each character has a default price of ¬£30, but that can be different if you are given 2 parameters instead of 1.



You can not use multiplier "*" operator.



If your name would be Jeong-Ho Aristotelis, ad would cost ¬£600.

20 leters * 30 = 600 (Space counts as a character).
