## Kata Description


Create a method `sayHello`/`say_hello`/`SayHello` that takes as input a name, city, and state to welcome a person. Note that `name` will be an array consisting of one or more values that should be joined together with one space between each, and the length of the `name` array in test cases will vary.



Example:



```javascript

sayHello(['John', 'Smith'], 'Phoenix', 'Arizona')

```

```python

say_hello(['John', 'Smith'], 'Phoenix', 'Arizona')

```

```ruby

say_hello(['John', 'Smith'], 'Phoenix', 'Arizona')

```

```elixir

say_hello(["John", "Smith"], "Phoenix", "Arizona")

```

```java

sayHello(new String[]{"John", "Smith"}, "Phoenix", "Arizona")

```

```csharp

Kata.SayHello(new String[]{"John", "Smith"}, "Phoenix", "Arizona")

```

```cpp

say_hello({"John", "Smith"}, "Phoenix", "Arizona")

```

```c

say_hello({"John", "Smith"}, 2, "Phoenix", "Arizona")

```



This example will return the string `Hello, John Smith! Welcome to Phoenix, Arizona!`
