## Kata Description


Our football team has finished the championship.



Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format `"x:y"`, where `x` is our team's score and `y` is our opponents score.



For example:

```["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]```



Points are awarded for each match as follows:

- if x > y: 3 points (win)

- if x < y: 0 points (loss)

- if x = y: 1 point  (tie)



We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (`x`) got in the championship by the rules given above.



Notes:

- our team always plays 10 matches in the championship

- 0 <= x <= 4

- 0 <= y <= 4
