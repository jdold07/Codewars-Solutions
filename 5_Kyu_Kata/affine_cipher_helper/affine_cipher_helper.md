## Kata Description


[The term "affine" was introduced to mathematics by Leonhard Euler in 1748.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#History) It comes from the Latin word *affinis* meaning "related." An *affine transformation* preserves the ratios of distances between points on a straight line. I.e. if you seek to generalize the concept, think of the characters of your alphabet as points on a straight line.



[The Affine Cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher) is a monoalphabetic cipher that is slightly stronger than a Caesar Cipher. Given the modern alphabet, the Caesar Cipher has 26 possible keys, while the Affine Cipher has 312 possible keys. The Affine Cipher maps to the Caesar Cipher when `a = 1`, and the Atbash Cipher when `a = b = m - 1`.



There are four factors that go into the cipher:



* *x*, the position in the alphabet of the current letter

* *a*, a number that must be coprime with the length of the alphabet (i.e. gcd(a, m) = 1)

* *b*, an non-negative integer 

* *m*, the length of the alphabet



The formula `(a * x + b) % m` evaluates to the position of the letter in the alphabet to substitute.



Write a class that provides encode and decode methods for the Affine Cipher.



**Note:** Your constructor must throw an error if *a* is not coprime with *m*.



The function gcd has been provided to give you the greatest common denominator of two numbers. E.g. `gcd(2, 4) == 2`
