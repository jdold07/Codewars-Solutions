## Kata Description


Given a list of strings, the goal is to group all strings together which are the same under some [caesar shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). 



For example if we apply `caesar 5 "haskell"` the result would be `"mfxpjqq"`. Similarly `caesar 17 "haskell" = "yrjbvcc"`. 



Then `caesarSort ["mfxpjqq","yrjbvcc"] = [["mfxpjqq","yrjbvcc"]]` as `caesar 21 "mfxpjqq" = "haskell"` and `caesar 9 "yrjbvcc" = "haskell"`. 



The input will be a list of lower case strings (letters from `a` to `z`). The order of the output does not matter. 



Some more examples

```haskell

caesarSort ["a","b"] == [["a","b"]]

caesarSort ["ab","ac"] == [["ab"],["ac"]]

caesarSort ["za","yz"] == [["za","yz"]]

caesarSort ["ab","zz","bc"] == [["ab","bc"],["zz"]]

```

```javascript

caesarSort(["a","b"]) === [["a","b"]]

caesarSort(["ab","ac"]) === [["ab"],["ac"]]

caesarSort(["za","yz"]) === [["za","yz"]]

caesarSort(["ab","zz","bc"]) === [["ab","bc"],["zz"]]

```
