## Kata Description


A [perfect power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_power) is a classification of positive integers:



> In mathematics, a **perfect power** is a positive integer that can be expressed as an integer power of another positive integer. More formally, n is a perfect power if there exist natural numbers m > 1, and k > 1 such that m<sup>k</sup> = n.



Your task is to check wheter a given integer is a perfect power. If it is a perfect power, return a pair `m` and `k` with m<sup>k</sup> = n as a proof. Otherwise return `Nothing`, `Nil`, `null`, `NULL`, `None` or your language's equivalent.



**Note:** For a perfect power, there might be several pairs. For example `81 = 3^4 = 9^2`, so `(3,4)` and `(9,2)` are valid solutions. However, the tests take care of this, so if a number is a perfect power, return any pair that proves it.



### Examples

```javascript

Test.describe("perfect powers", function(){

  Test.it("should work for some examples",function(){

    Test.assertSimilar(isPP(4), [2,2], "4 = 2^2");

    Test.assertSimilar(isPP(9), [3,2], "9 = 3^2");

    Test.assertEquals( isPP(5), null, "5 isn't a perfect number");

  });

});

```

```coffeescript

Test.describe "perfect powers", ->

  Test.it "should work for some examples", ->

    Test.assertSimilar isPP(4), [ 2, 2 ], "4 = 2^2"

    Test.assertSimilar isPP(9), [ 3, 2 ], "9 = 3^2"

    Test.assertEquals isPP(5), null, "5 isn't a perfect number"

```

```haskell

isPP 4 `shouldBe` Just (2,2)

isPP 9 `shouldBe` Just (3,2)

isPP 5 `shouldBe` Nothing

```

```python

isPP(4) => [2,2]

isPP(9) => [3,2]

isPP(5) => None

```

```ruby

isPP(4) => [2,2]

isPP(9) => [3,2]

isPP(5) => nil

```

```java

isPerfectPower(4) => new int[]{2,2}

isPerfectPower(5) => null

isPerfectPower(8) => new int[]{2,3}

isPerfectPower(9) => new int[]{3,2}

```

```r

isPP(4) => 2 2

isPP(9) => 3 2

isPP(5) => NULL

```

```csharp

IsPerfectPower(4) => (2,2)

IsPerfectPower(5) => null

IsPerfectPower(8) => (2,3)

IsPerfectPower(9) => (3,2)

```
