## Kata Description


Your job is to write a function which increments a string, to create a new string.



- If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1.

- If the string does not end with a number. the number 1 should be appended to the new string.



Examples:



`foo -> foo1`



`foobar23 -> foobar24`



`foo0042 -> foo0043`



`foo9 -> foo10`



`foo099 -> foo100`



*Attention: If the number has leading zeros the amount of digits should be considered.*
