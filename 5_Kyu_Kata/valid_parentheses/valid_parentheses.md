## Kata Description


Write a function that takes a string of parentheses, and determines if the order of the parentheses is valid. The function should return `true` if the string is valid, and `false` if it's invalid.



## Examples



```

"()"              =>  true

")(()))"          =>  false

"("               =>  false

"(())((()())())"  =>  true

```



## Constraints



`0 <= input.length <= 100`



~~~if-not:javascript,go,cobol

Along with opening (`(`) and closing (`)`) parenthesis, input may contain any valid ASCII characters.  Furthermore, the input string may be empty and/or not contain any parentheses at all.  Do **not** treat other forms of brackets as parentheses (e.g. `[]`, `{}`, `<>`).
