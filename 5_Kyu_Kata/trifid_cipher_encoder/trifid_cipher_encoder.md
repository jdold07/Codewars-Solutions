## Kata Description


In this challenge, you must write a function which can encipher plaintext text using Delastelle's Trifid cipher, as well as a function to decode back to plaintext. You will be passed a 27 letter key, a break period, and a string containing the data to be encoded or decoded. The function should return a string.



The key, data, and output will all contain exclusively valid uppercase letters using plus signs as the 27th letter. Keys will always be a complete 27-letter alphabet with no repeats, and periods will always be positive integers (in other words, there are no tricks in the inputs).



### Description of the cipher from [Practical Cryptography](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/trifid-cipher/):



The key is in the form of 3 squares:



`key = EPSDUCVWYM+ZLKXNBTFGORIJHAQ`

```                                 

square 1   square 2   square 3   

                                 

  1 2 3      1 2 3      1 2 3    

1 E P S    1 M + Z    1 F G O    

2 D U C    2 L K X    2 R I J    

3 V W Y    3 N B T    3 H A Q    

```

As an example, we will encipher the text `DEFEND THE EAST WALL OF THE CASTLE+`. The first step means locating the plaintext letters in the squares above, D is in square 1, row 2, column 1, so D becomes 121. In the same manner, E becomes 111. If we write down the numbers corresponding to each letter vertically, it becomes:

```

D E F E N D T H E E A S T W A L L O F T H E C A S T L E +

1 1 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 1 3 1 2 1 3 2 2 3 3 2 3 1 1 3 1 2 2 1 2

2 1 1 1 3 2 3 3 1 1 3 1 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 3 3 1 2 3 1 3 2 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 2 3 3 2 2 1 1 3 1 3 1 1 3 2 3 3 1 1 2

```

At the moment this is still a substitution cipher and fairly easy to break. The next step is to use a 'period', which is a number usually 5 - 20, which is part of the key material agreed on by both sender and receiver. If we take a period of 5,

```

D E F E N  D T H E E  A S T W A  L L O F T  H E C A S  T L E +

1 1 3 1 2  1 2 3 1 1  3 1 2 1 3  2 2 3 3 2  3 1 1 3 1  2 2 1 2

2 1 1 1 3  2 3 3 1 1  3 1 3 3 3  2 2 1 1 3  3 1 2 3 1  3 2 1 1 

1 1 1 1 1  1 3 1 1 1  2 3 3 2 2  1 1 3 1 3  1 1 3 2 3  3 1 1 2

```

we group the numbers. We now read off the numbers in each group horizontally, and do the substitution back to letters using the original keysquare.

```

113 122 111 311 111  123 112 331 113 111  312 133 133 323 322

S   U   E   F   E    C   P   H   S   E    G   Y   Y   J   I   



223 322 211 311 313  311 313 123 111 323   221 232 113 112

X   I   M   F   O    F   O   C   E   J     L   B   S   P

```

Which means `DEFEND THE EAST WALL OF THE CASTLE+` is enciphered to `SUEFECPHSEGYYJIXIMFOFOCEJLBSP` using the key square above and a period of 5.
