## Kata Description


My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)". John is worried because

each month a list with the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list

which means he is the heaviest. 



I am the one who establishes the list so I told him:

"Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list".

It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits. 



For example `99` will have "weight" `18`, `100` will have "weight" `1` so in the list `100` will come before `99`.



Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string ordered by "weights" of these numbers?



#### Example:

```

"56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" ordered by numbers weights becomes: 



"100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"



```



When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings (alphabetical ordering) and not numbers:



`180` is before `90` since, having the same "weight" (9),  it comes before as a *string*.



All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.



#### Notes



- it may happen that the input string have leading, trailing whitespaces and more than a unique whitespace between two consecutive numbers

- For C: The result is freed.
