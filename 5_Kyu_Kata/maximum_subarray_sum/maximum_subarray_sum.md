## Kata Description


The maximum sum subarray problem consists in finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of integers:



```haskell

maxSequence [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]

-- should be 6: [4, -1, 2, 1]

```

```javascript

maxSequence([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4])

// should be 6: [4, -1, 2, 1]

```

```python

max_sequence([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4])

# should be 6: [4, -1, 2, 1]

```

```clojure

(max-sequence [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4])

;; should be 6: [4, -1, 2, 1]

```

```java

Max.sequence(new int[]{-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4});

// should be 6: {4, -1, 2, 1}

```

```kotlin

maxSequence(listOf(-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4));

// should be 6: listOf(4, -1, 2, 1)

```

```c

maxSequence({-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4}, 9)

// should return 6, from sub-array: {4, -1, 2, 1}

```

```cpp

maxSequence({-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4});

//should be 6: {4, -1, 2, 1}

```

```rust

max_sequence(&[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]);

//should be 6: [4, -1, 2, 1]

```



Easy case is when the list is made up of only positive numbers and the maximum sum is the sum of the whole array. If the list is made up of only negative numbers, return 0 instead.



Empty list is considered to have zero greatest sum. Note that the empty list or array is also a valid sublist/subarray.
