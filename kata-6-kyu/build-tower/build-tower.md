## Kata Description


Build Tower

---



Build a pyramid-shaped tower, as an array/list of strings, given a positive integer `number of floors`. A tower block is represented with `"*"` character.



For example, a tower with `3` floors looks like this:



```

[

  "  *  ",

  " *** ", 

  "*****"

]

```



And a tower with `6` floors looks like this:



```

[

  "     *     ", 

  "    ***    ", 

  "   *****   ", 

  "  *******  ", 

  " ********* ", 

  "***********"

]

```
