## Kata Description


A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed.



Each segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed, for example:



```

11111111  00000000  00001111  10101010

 (byte1)   (byte2)   (byte3)   (byte4)

```



should become:



```

10101010  00001111  00000000  11111111

 (byte4)   (byte3)   (byte2)   (byte1)

```



The total number of bits will always be a multiple of 8.



The data is given in an array as such:



```

[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]

```



Note: In the C and NASM languages you are given the third parameter which is the number of segment blocks.
