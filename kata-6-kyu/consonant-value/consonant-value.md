## Kata Description


Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except `"aeiou"`. 



We shall assign the following values: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26`.



For example, for the word "zodiacs", let's cross out the vowels. We get: "z **~~o~~** d **~~ia~~** cs"



```haskell

-- The consonant substrings are: "z", "d" and "cs" and the values are z = 26, d = 4 and cs = 3 + 19 = 22. The highest is 26.

solve("zodiacs") = 26



For the word "strength", solve("strength") = 57

-- The consonant substrings are: "str" and "ngth" with values "str" = 19 + 20 + 18 = 57 and "ngth" = 14 + 7 + 20 + 8 = 49. The highest is 57.

```



For C: do not mutate input.



More examples in test cases. Good luck!
