## Kata Description

In a previous kata ( http://www.codewars.com/kata/547f1a8d4a437abdf800055c ) we try to create an object with **mutable** properties.

The function `NamedOne` taken `first` & `last` names as parameters, returned an object with `firstName`, `lastName` and `fullName` ( = `firstName` + a space + `lastName` ) properties. These properties were **mutable**.

For example, with a "NamedOne" like this :

```javascript
let namedOne = new NamedOne("Naomi", "Wang")

namedOne.fullName // -> "Naomi Wang"
```

...we were able to **change** its properties:

```javascript
namedOne.firstName = "John"

namedOne.lastName = "Doe"

namedOne.fullName // -> "John Doe"

//..or..

namedOne.fullName = "Bill Smith"

namedOne.firstName // -> "Bill"

namedOne.lastName // -> "Smith"
```

##Your mission

**On the contrary**, the purpose of this kata is to create an `OnceNamedOne` object with **immutable** properties.

That means `.firstName`, `.lastName` and `.fullName` are defined into the Constructor and can't be no more changed.

The properties are still **readable** using the dot or bracket notation but there're **not writable**.

##Examples:

```javascript
let onceNamed = new OnceNamedOne("Naomi", "Wang")

// ...then...

onceNamed.firstName // -> "Naomi"

onceNamed.lastName // -> "Wang"

onceNamed.fullName // -> "Naomi Wang"

// ...if you try : ...

onceNamed.firstName = "Bill"

// ...or...

onceNamed["lastName"] = "Smith"

// ...then...

onceNamed["firstName"] // -> "Naomi"

onceNamed["lastName"] // -> "Wang"

onceNamed["fullName"] // -> "Naomi Wang"

// ..but you can still create other instances..

let otherOne = new OnceNamedOne("Don", "Jones")

otherOne.fullName // -> "Don Jones"
```

Can you change our function to create such a `OnceNamedOne` object ?

(<small> **Hint**: in this kata you'll try to **define properties** of an **object**</small> )
