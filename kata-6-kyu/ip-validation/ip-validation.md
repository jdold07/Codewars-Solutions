## Kata Description


Write an algorithm that will identify valid IPv4 addresses in dot-decimal format. IPs should be considered valid if they consist of four octets, with values between `0` and `255`, inclusive.





#### Valid inputs examples:

```

Examples of valid inputs:

1.2.3.4

123.45.67.89

```



#### Invalid input examples:

```

1.2.3

1.2.3.4.5

123.456.78.90

123.045.067.089

```



#### Notes:

- Leading zeros (e.g. `01.02.03.04`) are considered invalid

- Inputs are guaranteed to be a single string
