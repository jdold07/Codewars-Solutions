## Kata Description


Take the following IPv4 address:  128.32.10.1

This address has 4 octets where each octet is a single byte (or 8 bits).



* 1st octet 128 has the binary representation: 10000000

* 2nd octet 32 has the binary representation: 00100000

* 3rd octet 10 has the binary representation: 00001010

* 4th octet 1 has the binary representation: 00000001



So 128.32.10.1 == 10000000.00100000.00001010.00000001



Because the above IP address has 32 bits, we can represent it as the 32

bit number: 2149583361.



Write a function ip_to_int32(ip) ( **JS**: `ipToInt32(ip)` ) that takes an IPv4 address and returns

a 32 bit number.



```ruby

  ip_to_int32("128.32.10.1") => 2149583361

```

```python

  ip_to_int32("128.32.10.1") => 2149583361

```

```javascript

  ipToInt32("128.32.10.1") => 2149583361

```
