## Kata Description


**Step 1:** Create a function called `encode()` to replace all the lowercase vowels in a given string with numbers according to the following pattern:

```

a -> 1

e -> 2

i -> 3

o -> 4

u -> 5

```



For example, `encode("hello")` would return `"h2ll4"`. There is no need to worry about uppercase vowels in this kata.



**Step 2:** Now create a function called `decode()` to turn the numbers back into vowels according to the same pattern shown above.



For example, `decode("h3 th2r2")` would return `"hi there"`.



For the sake of simplicity, you can assume that any numbers passed into the function will correspond to vowels.
