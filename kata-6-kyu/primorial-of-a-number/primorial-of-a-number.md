## Kata Description


# Definition (Primorial Of a Number)



*Is similar to factorial of a number*, **_In primorial_**, not all the natural numbers get multiplied, **_only prime numbers are multiplied to calculate the primorial of a number_**. It's denoted with **_P_**<sub>**_#_**</sub> and it is the product of the first n prime numbers.

___ 



# Task



**_Given_** *a number N* , **_calculate its primorial_**. ![!alt](https://i.imgur.com/mdX8dJP.png)  ![!alt](https://i.imgur.com/mdX8dJP.png)  

___



# Notes



* **_Only positive_** numbers *will be passed (N > 0)* .

___



# Input >> Output Examples:



``` cpp

1- numPrimorial (3) ==> return (30)

```

```prolog

1 - num_primorial(3, 30).

```

```rust

1 - num_primorial(3) // 30

```

```clojure

1 - (num-primorial 3) ;; 30

```



## **_Explanation_**:



**_Since_** *the passed number is (3)* ,**_Then_** **_the primorial_** *should obtained by multiplying*  ```2 * 3 * 5 = 30 .```



### Mathematically written as , **_P_**<sub>3</sub>**_#_** = 30 .

___ 



```cpp

2- numPrimorial (5) ==> return (2310)

```

```prolog

2 - num_primorial(5, 2310).

```

```rust

2 - num_primorial(5) // 2310

```

```clojure

2 - (num-primorial 5) ;; 2310

```



## **_Explanation_**:





**_Since_** *the passed number is (5)* ,**_Then_** **_the primorial_** *should obtained by multiplying*  ``` 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 2310 .```



### Mathematically written as , **_P_**<sub>5</sub>**_#_** = 2310 .

___



```cpp

3- numPrimorial (6) ==> return (30030)

```

```prolog

3 - num_primorial(6, 30030).

```

```rust

3 - num_primorial(6) // 30030

```

```clojure

3 - (num-primorial 6) ;; 30030

```



## **_Explanation_**: 



**_Since_** *the passed number is (6)* ,**_Then_** **_the primorial_** *should obtained by multiplying*  ``` 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 30030 .```



### Mathematically written as , **_P_**<sub>6</sub>**_#_** = 30030 .
