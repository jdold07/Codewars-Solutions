## Kata Description


You are given a string of `n` lines, each substring being `n` characters long: For example:



`s = "abcd\nefgh\nijkl\nmnop"`



We will study some transformations of this square of strings.



- Clock rotation 180 degrees: rot

```

rot(s) => "ponm\nlkji\nhgfe\ndcba"

```

- selfie_and_rot(s) (or selfieAndRot or selfie-and-rot)

It is initial string + string obtained by clock rotation 180 degrees with dots interspersed in order (hopefully) to better show the rotation when printed.

```

s = "abcd\nefgh\nijkl\nmnop" --> 

"abcd....\nefgh....\nijkl....\nmnop....\n....ponm\n....lkji\n....hgfe\n....dcba"

```

or printed:



```

|rotation        |selfie_and_rot

|abcd --> ponm   |abcd --> abcd....

|efgh     lkji   |efgh     efgh....

|ijkl     hgfe   |ijkl     ijkl....   

|mnop     dcba   |mnop     mnop....

                           ....ponm

                           ....lkji

                           ....hgfe

                           ....dcba

```

Notice that the *number of dots* is the *common length* of "abcd", "efgh", "ijkl", "mnop".



#### Task:

- Write these two functions `rot`and `selfie_and_rot`



and



- high-order function `oper(fct, s)` where



 - fct is the function of one variable f to apply to the string `s`

(fct will be one of `rot, selfie_and_rot`)



#### Examples:

```

s = "abcd\nefgh\nijkl\nmnop"

oper(rot, s) => "ponm\nlkji\nhgfe\ndcba"

oper(selfie_and_rot, s) => "abcd....\nefgh....\nijkl....\nmnop....\n....ponm\n....lkji\n....hgfe\n....dcba"

```

#### Notes:

- The form of the parameter `fct` in oper

changes according to the language. You can see each form according to the language in "Your test cases".

- It could be easier to take these katas from number (I) to number (IV)



Forthcoming katas will study other tranformations.



####  Bash Note:

The input strings are separated by `,` instead of `\n`. The ouput strings should be separated by `\r` instead of `\n`. See "Sample Tests".
