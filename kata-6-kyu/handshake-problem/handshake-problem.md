## Kata Description


Johnny is a farmer and he annually holds a beet farmers convention "Drop the beet".



Every year he takes photos of farmers handshaking. Johnny knows that no two farmers handshake more than once. He also knows that some of the possible handshake combinations may not happen.



However, Johnny would like to know the minimal amount of people that participated this year just by counting all the handshakes.



Help Johnny by writing a function, that takes the amount of handshakes and returns the minimal amount of people needed to perform these handshakes (a pair of farmers handshake only once).

###### *This Kata description was compiled by [**JDOld07**](https://tpstech.dev) with data provided by the [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com) API.*

###### *The solutions in each language code file associated with this kata are my solutions unless otherwise noted in the code file.  Test cases are most often verbatim of those provided by the Kata.  However, in some cases it has been necessary to modify the test cases in order to have them function with my test runners and in my local environment.  On occasion, I may have added additional test cases to those provided.  Also, though I can't recall an instance, there may potentially have been reason to remove test cases for functional reasons.  Some Kata's also require (*or have*) code preloaded for their operation.  This code is included if it was required to make the tests work.  It is clearly identified under a **PRELOAD CODE** header if included.*

###### Most of my solutions are not commented (*though this will hopefully change*) as solutions are rarely submitted with comments on [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com).*
