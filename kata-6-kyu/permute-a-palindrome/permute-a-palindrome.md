## Kata Description


Write a function that will check whether ANY permutation of the characters  of the input string is a palindrome. Bonus points for a solution that is efficient and/or that uses _only_ built-in language functions. Deem yourself **brilliant** if you can come up with a version that does not use _any_ function whatsoever.



# Example 



  `madam` -> True   

  `adamm` -> True   

  `junk`  -> False  

  

## Hint 

The brute force approach would be to generate _all_ the permutations of the string and check each one of them whether it is a palindrome. However, an optimized approach will not require this at all.

###### *This Kata description was compiled by [**JDOld07**](https://tpstech.dev) with data provided by the [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com) API.*

###### *The solutions in each language code file associated with this kata are my solutions unless otherwise noted in the code file.  Test cases are most often verbatim of those provided by the Kata.  However, in some cases it has been necessary to modify the test cases in order to have them function with my test runners and in my local environment.  On occasion, I may have added additional test cases to those provided.  Also, though I can't recall an instance, there may potentially have been reason to remove test cases for functional reasons.  Some Kata's also require (*or have*) code preloaded for their operation.  This code is included if it was required to make the tests work.  It is clearly identified under a **PRELOAD CODE** header if included.*

###### Most of my solutions are not commented (*though this will hopefully change*) as solutions are rarely submitted with comments on [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com).*
