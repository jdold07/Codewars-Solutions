## Kata Description


Let us consider this example (array written in general format):



`ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]`



Its following parts:

```

ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]

ls = [1, 3, 6, 10]

ls = [3, 6, 10]

ls = [6, 10]

ls = [10]

ls = []

```

The corresponding sums are (put together in a list):

`[20, 20, 19, 16, 10, 0]`



The function `parts_sums` (or its variants in other languages) will take as parameter a list `ls`

and return a list of the sums of its parts as defined above.



#### Other Examples:

```

ls = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 

parts_sums(ls) -> [21, 20, 18, 15, 11, 6, 0]



ls = [744125, 935, 407, 454, 430, 90, 144, 6710213, 889, 810, 2579358]

parts_sums(ls) -> [10037855, 9293730, 9292795, 9292388, 9291934, 9291504, 9291414, 9291270, 2581057, 2580168, 2579358, 0]

```

#### Notes

- Take a look at performance: some lists have thousands of elements.

- Please ask before translating.
