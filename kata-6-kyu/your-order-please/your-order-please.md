## Kata Description


Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.



Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).



If the input string is empty, return an empty string.

The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.





## Examples



```

"is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"

"4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"

""  -->  ""

```
