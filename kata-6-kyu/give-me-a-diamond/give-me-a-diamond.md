## Kata Description


Jamie is a programmer, and James' girlfriend. She likes diamonds, and wants a diamond string from James. Since James doesn't know how to make this happen, he needs your help.



## Task



You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (`*`) characters. Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must be terminated with a newline character (`\n`).



Return `null/nil/None/...` if the input is an even number or negative, as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.





## Examples



A size 3 diamond:



```

 *

***

 *

```



...which would appear as a string of `" *\n***\n *\n"`





A size 5 diamond:



```

  *

 ***

*****

 ***

  *

```



...that is: 

```

"  *\n ***\n*****\n ***\n  *\n"

```
