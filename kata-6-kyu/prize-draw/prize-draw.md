## Kata Description


To participate in a prize draw each one gives his/her firstname. 



Each letter of a firstname

has a value which is its rank in the English alphabet. `A` and `a` have rank `1`, `B` and `b` rank `2` and so on. 



The *length* of the firstname is added to the *sum* of these ranks hence a number `som`. 



An array of random weights is linked to the firstnames and each `som` is multiplied by its corresponding weight to get what they call a `winning number`.



#### Example:

```

names: "COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH"

weights: [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1]



PauL -> som = length of firstname + 16 + 1 + 21 + 12 = 4 + 50 -> 54

The *weight* associated with PauL is 2 so PauL's *winning number* is 54 * 2 = 108.

```

Now one can sort the firstnames in *decreasing* order of the `winning numbers`. When two people have the same `winning number` sort them *alphabetically* by their firstnames.



#### Task:



- parameters: `st` a string of firstnames, `we` an array of weights, `n` a rank 



- return: the firstname of the participant whose rank is `n` 

(ranks are numbered from 1)



#### Example:

```

names: "COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH"

weights: [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1]

n: 4



The function should return: "PauL"

```

#### Notes:

- The weight array is at least as long as the number of names, it may be longer.



- If `st` is empty return "No participants".



- If n is greater than the number of participants then return "Not enough participants".



- See Examples Test Cases for more examples.
