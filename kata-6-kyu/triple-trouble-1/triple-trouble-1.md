## Kata Description


Write a function 

```csharp

TripleDouble(long num1, long num2)

```

```java

TripleDouble(long num1, long num2)

```

```javascript 

tripledouble(num1,num2)

```

```python

triple_double(num1, num2)

```

```ruby

triple_double(num1, num2)

```

```scala

tripleDouble(num1: Long, num2: Long): Int

```

which takes numbers `num1` and `num2` and returns `1` if there is a straight triple of a number at any place in `num1` and also a straight double of the **same** number in `num2`.



If this isn't the case, return `0`





## Examples



```javascript

tripledouble(451999277, 41177722899) == 1 // num1 has straight triple 999s and 

                                          // num2 has straight double 99s



tripledouble(1222345, 12345) == 0 // num1 has straight triple 2s but num2 has only a single 2



tripledouble(12345, 12345) == 0



tripledouble(666789, 12345667) == 1

```



```csharp

TripleDouble(451999277, 41177722899) == 1 // num1 has straight triple 999s and 

                                          // num2 has straight double 99s



TripleDouble(1222345, 12345) == 0 // num1 has straight triple 2s but num2 has only a single 2



TripleDouble(12345, 12345) == 0



TripleDouble(666789, 12345667) == 1

```



```java

TripleDouble(451999277, 41177722899) == 1 // num1 has straight triple 999s and 

                                          // num2 has straight double 99s



TripleDouble(1222345, 12345) == 0 // num1 has straight triple 2s but num2 has only a single 2



TripleDouble(12345, 12345) == 0



TripleDouble(666789, 12345667) == 1

```



```python

triple_double(451999277, 41177722899) == 1

# num1 has straight triple 999s and num2 has straight double 99s



triple_double(1222345, 12345) == 0

# num1 has straight triple 2s but num2 has only a single 2



triple_double(12345, 12345) == 0



triple_double(666789, 12345667) == 1

```



```ruby

triple_double(451999277, 41177722899) == 1

# num1 has straight triple 999s and  num2 has straight double 99s



triple_double(1222345, 12345) == 0

# num1 has straight triple 2s but num2 has only a single 2



triple_double(12345, 12345) == 0



triple_double(666789, 12345667) == 1

```



```scala

// num1 has straight triple 999s and num2 has straight double 99s

tripleDouble(451999277, 41177722899) == 1



// num1 has straight triple 2s but num2 has only a single 2:

tripleDouble(1222345, 12345) == 0



tripleDouble(12345, 12345) == 0



tripleDouble(666789, 12345667) == 1

```
