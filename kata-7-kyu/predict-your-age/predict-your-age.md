## Kata Description


My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!



In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!



* Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.  

* Multiply each number by itself.  

* Add them all together.  

* Take the square root of the result.  

* Divide by two.



## Example



```javascript

predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86

```

```R

predict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86

```

```python

predict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86

```

```ruby

predict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86

```

```crystal

predict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86

```

```c++

predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86

```

```php

predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86

```

```csharp

predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86

```

```lua

Predicter.predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86

```







Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.



Some random tests might fail due to a bug in the JavaScript implementation. Simply resubmit if that happens to you.
