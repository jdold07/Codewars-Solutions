## Kata Description


This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function `accum`:



#### Examples:

```

accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"

accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"

accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"

```



The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from `a..z` and `A..Z`.
