## Kata Description


You are given two arrays `a1` and `a2` of strings. Each string is composed with letters from `a` to `z`.

Let `x` be any string in the first array and `y` be any string in the second array. 



  `Find max(abs(length(x) ‚àí length(y)))`



If `a1` and/or `a2` are empty return `-1` in each language

except in Haskell (F#) where you will return `Nothing` (None).



#### Example:

```

a1 = ["hoqq", "bbllkw", "oox", "ejjuyyy", "plmiis", "xxxzgpsssa", "xxwwkktt", "znnnnfqknaz", "qqquuhii", "dvvvwz"]

a2 = ["cccooommaaqqoxii", "gggqaffhhh", "tttoowwwmmww"]

mxdiflg(a1, a2) --> 13



```



#### Bash note:

 - input : 2 strings with substrings separated by `,`

 - output: number as a string
