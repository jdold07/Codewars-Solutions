## Kata Description


Have you heard about the myth that [if you fold a paper enough times, you can reach the moon with it](http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/31/paper-folding-to-the-moon/)? Sure you have, but exactly how many? Maybe it's time to write a program to figure it out.



You know that a piece of paper has a thickness of `0.0001m`. Given `distance` in units of meters, calculate how many times you have to fold the paper to make the paper reach this distance.  

(If you're not familiar with the concept of folding a paper: Each fold doubles its total thickness.)



Note: Of course you can't do half a fold. You should know what this means ;P



Also, if somebody is giving you a negative distance, it's clearly bogus and you should yell at them by returning `null` (or whatever equivalent in your language). In Shell please return `None`. In C and COBOL please return `-1`.
