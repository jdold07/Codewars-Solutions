## Kata Description


To complete this Kata you need to make a function `multiplyAll`/`multiply_all` which takes an array of integers as an argument. This function must return another function, which takes a single integer as an argument and returns a new array. 



The returned array should consist of each of the elements from the first array multiplied by the integer.



Example:



```javascript

multiplyAll([1, 2, 3])(2) = [2, 4, 6];

```

```php

multiply_all([1, 2, 3])(2); // => [2, 4, 6]

```

```python

multiply_all([1, 2, 3])(2); // => [2, 4, 6]

```

```scala

CurryingFunctions.multiplyAll(Array(1, 2, 3))(2); // => Array(2, 4, 6)

```



You must not mutate the original array.



Here's a [nice Youtube video about currying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZLP4qOwY8I), which might help you if this is new to you.
