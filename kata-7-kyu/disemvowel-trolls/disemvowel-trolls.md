## Kata Description


Trolls are attacking your comment section!



A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.



Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.



For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".



Note: for this kata `y` isn't considered a vowel.
