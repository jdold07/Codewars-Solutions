## Kata Description


**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students**



All Star Code Challenge #22



Create a function that takes an integer argument of seconds and converts the value into a string describing how many hours and minutes comprise that many seconds.



Any remaining seconds left over are ignored.



Note:  

The string output needs to be in the specific form - "X hour(s) and X minute(s)"



~~~ if:c

For C:  

Memory must be allocated

~~~



For example:

```

3600 --> "1 hour(s) and 0 minute(s)"

3601 --> "1 hour(s) and 0 minute(s)"

3500 --> "0 hour(s) and 58 minute(s)"

323500 --> "89 hour(s) and 51 minute(s)"

```
