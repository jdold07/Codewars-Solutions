## Kata Description


A [sequence or a series](http://world.mathigon.org/Sequences), in mathematics, is a string of objects, like numbers, that follow a particular pattern. The individual elements in a sequence are called terms. A simple example is `3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, ...`, where the pattern is: _"add 3 to the previous term"_.



In this kata, we will be using a more complicated sequence:   `0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ...`

This sequence is generated with the pattern: _"the nth term is the sum of numbers from 0 to n, inclusive"_.



```

[ 0,  1,    3,      6,   ...]

  0  0+1  0+1+2  0+1+2+3

```



## Your Task



Complete the function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list/array of length `abs(n) + 1` of the arithmetic series explained above. When`n < 0` return the sequence with negative terms.



## Examples 



```

 5  -->  [0,  1,  3,  6,  10,  15]

-5  -->  [0, -1, -3, -6, -10, -15]

 7  -->  [0,  1,  3,  6,  10,  15,  21,  28]

```
