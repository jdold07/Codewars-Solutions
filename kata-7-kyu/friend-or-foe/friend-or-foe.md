## Kata Description


Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.



If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...



~~~if-not:factor

Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

~~~



~~~if:factor

Ex: Input = `{ "Ryan" "Kieran" "Jason" "Yous" }`, Output = `{ "Ryan" "Yous" }`

~~~



i.e.

```haskell

friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]

```



```factor

{ "Ryan" "Kieran" "Mark" } friend -> { "Ryan" "Mark" }

```





Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.
