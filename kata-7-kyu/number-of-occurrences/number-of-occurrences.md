## Kata Description

Write a function that returns the number of occurrences of an element in an array.

### Examples

```javascript
let arr = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]

arr.numberOfOccurrences(0) === 1

arr.numberOfOccurrences(4) === 0

arr.numberOfOccurrences(2) === 2

arr.numberOfOccurrences("a") === 0
```

```haskell

let sample = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]

numberOfOccurrences 0 sample `shouldBe` 1

numberOfOccurrences 4 sample `shouldBe` 0

numberOfOccurrences 2 sample `shouldBe` 2

```

```python

sample = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]

number_of_occurrences(0, sample) == 1

number_of_occurrences(4, sample) == 0

number_of_occurrences(2, sample) == 2

number_of_occurrences(3, sample) == 1

```

```csharp

let sample = { 1, 0, 2, 2, 3 };

NumberOfOccurrences(0, sample) == 1;

NumberOfOccurrences(4, sample) == 0;

NumberOfOccurrences(2, sample) == 2;

NumberOfOccurrences(3, sample) == 1;

```

```cfml

let sample = [ 1, 0, 2, 2, 3 ]

numberOfOccurences(0, sample) == 1

numberOfOccurences(4, sample) == 0

numberOfOccurences(2, sample) == 2

numberOfOccurences(3, sample) == 1

```

```prolog

sample = [ 1, 0, 2, 2, 3 ].

number_of_occurrences(0, sample, 1).

number_of_occurrences(4, sample, 0).

number_of_occurrences(2, sample, 2).

number_of_occurrences(3, sample, 1).

```
