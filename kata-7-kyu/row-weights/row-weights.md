___

# Task



**_Given_** *an array of positive integers (the weights of the people)*, **_return_** *a new array/tuple of two integers*, **_where_** **_the first_** one is the **_total weight of team 1_**, and **_the second_** one is the **_total weight of team 2_**.

___

# Notes 



* **_Array size_** is *at least 1*.

* **_All numbers_** will be **positive**.

___

# Input >> Output Examples 



```cpp

rowWeights([13, 27, 49])  ==>  return (62, 27)

```

```prolog

row_weights([13, 27, 49], [62, 27]).

```



## **_Explanation_**:



**_The first element_** `62` is *the total weight of team 1*, and **_the second element_** `27` is *the total weight of team 2*.

___

```cpp

rowWeights([50, 60, 70, 80])  ==>  return (120, 140)

```

```prolog

row_weights([50, 60, 70, 80], [120, 140]).

```

## **_Explanation_**:



**_The first element_** `120` is *the total weight of team 1*, and **_the second element_** `140` is *the total weight of team 2*.

___

```cpp

rowWeights([80])  ==>  return (80, 0)

```

```prolog

row_weights([80], [80, 0]).

```

## **_Explanation_**:



**_The first element_** `80` is *the total weight of team 1*, and **_the second element_** `0` is *the total weight of team 2*.
