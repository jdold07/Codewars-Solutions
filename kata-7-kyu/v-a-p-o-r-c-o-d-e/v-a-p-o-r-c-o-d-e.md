## Kata Description


ASC Week 1 Challenge 4 (Medium #1) 



Write a function that converts any sentence into a V  A  P  O  R  W  A  V  E sentence. a V  A  P  O  R  W  A  V  E sentence converts all the letters into uppercase, and adds 2 spaces between each letter (or special character) to create this V  A  P  O  R  W  A  V  E effect. 



**Note that spaces should be ignored in this case.**



## Examples

``` 

"Lets go to the movies"       -->  "L  E  T  S  G  O  T  O  T  H  E  M  O  V  I  E  S"

"Why isn't my code working?"  -->  "W  H  Y  I  S  N  '  T  M  Y  C  O  D  E  W  O  R  K  I  N  G  ?"

```
