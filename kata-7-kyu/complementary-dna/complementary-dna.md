## Kata Description


Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.



If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA



In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". 

Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).



More similar exercise are found here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)



Example: (**input --> output**)

~~~if-not:haskell

```

"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"

"GTAT" --> "CATA"

```

~~~

```if:haskell

dnaStrand []        `shouldBe` []

dnaStrand [A,T,G,C] `shouldBe` [T,A,C,G]

dnaStrand [G,T,A,T] `shouldBe` [C,A,T,A]

dnaStrand [A,A,A,A] `shouldBe` [T,T,T,T]

```
