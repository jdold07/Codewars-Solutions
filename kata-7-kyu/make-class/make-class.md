## Kata Description


I don't like writing classes like this:



```javascript

function Animal(name,species,age,health,weight,color) {

  this.name = name;

  this.species = species;

  this.age = age;

  this.health = health;

  this.weight = weight;

  this.color = color;

}

```

```coffeescript

Animal = (@name, @species, @age, @health, @weight, @color) ->

```

```python

class Animal:

    def __init__(self, name, species, age, health, weight, color):

        self.name = name

        self.species = species

        self.age = age

        self.health = health

        self.weight = weight

        self.color = color

```



Give me the power to create a similar class like this:

```javascript

const Animal = makeClass("name","species","age","health","weight","color") 

```

```coffeescript

Animal = makeClass "name", "species", "age", "health", "weight", "color"

```

```python

Animal = make_class("name", "species", "age", "health", "weight", "color")

```
