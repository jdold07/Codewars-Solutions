## Kata Description


The two oldest ages function/method needs to be completed. It should take an array of numbers as its argument and return the **two highest numbers within the array**. The returned value should be an array in the format `[second oldest age,  oldest age]`. 



The order of the numbers passed in could be any order. The array will always include at least 2 items. If there are two or more oldest age, then return both of them in array format.



**For example (Input --> Output):**



```

[1, 2, 10, 8] --> [8, 10]

[1, 5, 87, 45, 8, 8] --> [45, 87]

[1, 3, 10, 0]) --> [3, 10]

```
