## Kata Description


#### Description



You are Saitama (a.k.a One Punch Man), and you are fighting against the monsters! You are strong enough to kill them with one punch, but after you punch 3 times, one of the remaining monsters will hit you once.



Your health is `health`; number of monsters is `monsters`, damage that monster can give you is `damage`.



#### Task



Write a function that will calculate:



how many hits you received, how much damage you received and your remaining health.



if your health is <= 0, you die and function should return `"hero died"`.



#### Examples



```

(100, 3, 33)  => "hits: 0, damage: 0, health: 100"

( 50, 7, 10)  => "hits: 2, damage: 20, health: 30"

```



#### Note



All numbers are strictly positive.  Your function should always return a string.



Have fun :)
