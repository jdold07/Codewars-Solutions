## Kata Description


## Task



Create a function called `one` that accepts two params:



* a sequence 

* a function



and returns `true` only if the function in the params returns `true` for exactly one (`1`) item in the sequence. 



## Example



```

one([1, 3, 5, 6, 99, 1, 3], bigger_than_ten) -> true

one([1, 3, 5, 6, 99, 88, 3], bigger_than_ten) -> false

one([1, 3, 5, 6, 5, 1, 3], bigger_than_ten) -> false

```
