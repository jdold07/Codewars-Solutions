## Kata Description


Given two numbers `x` and `n`, calculate the (positive) nth root of `x`; this means that being `r = result`, `r^n = x`





## Examples

```

x = 4     n = 2  -->  2    # the square root of 4 is 2     2^2 = 4

x = 8     n = 3  -->  2    # the cube root of 8 is 2       2^3 = 8

x = 256   n = 4  -->  4    # the 4th root of 256 is 4      4^4 = 256

x = 9     n = 2  -->  3    # the square root of 9 is 3     3^2 = 9

x = 6.25  n = 2  -->  2.5  #                             2.5^2 = 6.25

```



### Notes:



* `4 <= x < 10 ^ 20`

* `4 <= n <= 50`



Good luck!
