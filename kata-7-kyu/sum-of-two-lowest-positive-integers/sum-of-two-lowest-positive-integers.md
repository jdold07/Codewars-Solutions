## Kata Description


Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.



For example, when an array is passed like `[19, 5, 42, 2, 77]`, the output should be `7`.



`[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453]` should return `3453455`.
