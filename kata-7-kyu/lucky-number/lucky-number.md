## Kata Description


###Lucky number



Write a function to find if a number is lucky or not. If the sum of all digits is 0 or multiple of 9 then the number is lucky.



`1892376 => 1+8+9+2+3+7+6 = 36`. 36 is divisible by 9, hence number is lucky.





Function will return `true` for lucky numbers and `false` for others.
