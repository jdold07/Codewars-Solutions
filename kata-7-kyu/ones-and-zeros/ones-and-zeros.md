## Kata Description


Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.



Eg: `[0, 0, 0, 1]` is treated as `0001` which is the binary representation of `1`.



Examples:

```

Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1

Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2

Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5

Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9

Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2

Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6

Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15

Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11

```



However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to `4`.
