## Kata Description


Complete the solution so that it returns a formatted string. The return value should equal "Value is VALUE"  where value is a 5 digit padded number. 



Example:



```cpp

solution(5); // should return "Value is 00005"

```

```c

solution(5); // should return "Value is 00005"

```

```factor

5 solution ! should return "Value is 00005"

```

```haskell

solution 5  -- should return "Value is 00005"

```

```javascript

solution(5) // should return "Value is 00005"

```

```python

solution(5)  # should return "Value is 00005"

```
