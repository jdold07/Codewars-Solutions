## Kata Description


You must implement a function that returns the difference between the largest and the smallest value in a given `list / array` (`lst`) received as the parameter.



* `lst` contains integers, that means it may contain some negative numbers

* if `lst` is empty or contains a single element, return `0`

* `lst` is not sorted



```c

[1, 2, 3, 4]   //  returns 3 because 4 -   1  == 3

[1, 2, 3, -4]  //  returns 7 because 3 - (-4) == 7

```



Have fun!
