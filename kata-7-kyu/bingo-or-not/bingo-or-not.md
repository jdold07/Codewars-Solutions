## Kata Description


For this game of `BINGO`, you will receive a single array of 10 numbers from 1 to 26 as an input. Duplicate numbers within the array are possible.



Each number corresponds to their alphabetical order letter (e.g. 1 = A. 2 = B, etc). Write a function where you will win the game if your numbers can spell `"BINGO"`. They do not need to be in the right order in the input array. Otherwise you will lose. Your outputs should be `"WIN"` or `"LOSE"` respectively.



~~~if:lambdacalc

#### Preloaded



`WIN, LOSE` are `Preloaded` for your convenience. You should return one of these values, as appropriate.



#### Encodings



purity: `LetRec`  

numEncoding: `Church`  

export constructors `nil, cons` for your `List` encoding
