## Kata Description


Common denominators



You will have a list of rationals in the form 

 ```

{ {numer_1, denom_1} , ... {numer_n, denom_n} } 

or

[ [numer_1, denom_1] , ... [numer_n, denom_n] ] 

or

[ (numer_1, denom_1) , ... (numer_n, denom_n) ] 

 ```

 

 where all numbers are positive ints.

 You have to produce a result in the form:

```

(N_1, D) ... (N_n, D) 

or

[ [N_1, D] ... [N_n, D] ] 

or

[ (N_1', D) , ... (N_n, D) ] 

or

{{N_1, D} ... {N_n, D}} 

or

"(N_1, D) ... (N_n, D)"

```



depending on the language (See Example tests) in which D is as small as possible and 

 

```

N_1/D == numer_1/denom_1 ... N_n/D == numer_n,/denom_n.

```

#### Example: 

```

convertFracs [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)] `shouldBe` [(6, 12), (4, 12), (3, 12)]

```

#### Note: 

Due to the fact that the first translations were written long ago - more than 6 years - these first translations have only irreducible fractions. 



Newer translations have some reducible fractions. To be on the safe side it is better to do a bit more work by simplifying fractions even if they don't have to be.



#### Note for Bash:

input is a string,  e.g `"2,4,2,6,2,8"`

output is then          `"6 12 4 12 3 12"`
