## Kata Description


This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:



```javascript

seven(times(five())); // must return 35

four(plus(nine())); // must return 13

eight(minus(three())); // must return 5

six(dividedBy(two())); // must return 3

```

```haskell

seven $ times $ five   ->  35 :: Int

four $ plus $ nine     ->  13 :: Int

eight $ minus $ three  ->   5 :: Int

six $ dividedBy $ two  ->   3 :: Int

```

```ruby

seven(times(five)) # must return 35

four(plus(nine)) # must return 13

eight(minus(three)) # must return 5

six(divided_by(two)) # must return 3

```

```python

seven(times(five())) # must return 35

four(plus(nine())) # must return 13

eight(minus(three())) # must return 5

six(divided_by(two())) # must return 3

```

```factor

seven multiplied-by five   ! must evaluate to 35

four plus nine             ! must evaluate to 13

eight minus three          ! must evaluate to 5

six divided-by two         ! must evaluate to 3

```



Requirements:

~~~if:ruby,python

* There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")

* There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, divided_by

* Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers

* The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand

* Division should be **integer division**. For example, this should return `2`, not `2.666666...`:

~~~

~~~if:factor

* There must be a word for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")

* There must be a word for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, multiplied-by, divided-by

* Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers

* The leftmost word represents the left operand, the rightmost word represents the right operand

* Division should be **integer division**. For example, this should return `2`, not `2.666666...`:

~~~

~~~if-not:ruby,python,factor

* There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")

* There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy

* Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers

* The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand

* Division should be **integer division**. For example, this should return `2`, not `2.666666...`:

~~~



```javascript

eight(dividedBy(three()));

```

```haskell

eight $ dividedBy $ three

```

```ruby

eight(divided_by(three))

```

```python

eight(divided_by(three()))

```

```factor

eight divided-by three

```
