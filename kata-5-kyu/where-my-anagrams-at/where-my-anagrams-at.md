## Kata Description


What is an anagram? Well, two words are anagrams of each other if they both contain the same letters. For example:



```

'abba' & 'baab' == true



'abba' & 'bbaa' == true



'abba' & 'abbba' == false



'abba' & 'abca' == false

```



Write a function that will find all the anagrams of a word from a list. You will be given two inputs a word and an array with words. You should return an array of all the anagrams or an empty array if there are none. For example:



```javascript

anagrams('abba', ['aabb', 'abcd', 'bbaa', 'dada']) => ['aabb', 'bbaa']



anagrams('racer', ['crazer', 'carer', 'racar', 'caers', 'racer']) => ['carer', 'racer']



anagrams('laser', ['lazing', 'lazy',  'lacer']) => []

```



```if:go

Empty string slice is expected when there are no anagrams found.

```
