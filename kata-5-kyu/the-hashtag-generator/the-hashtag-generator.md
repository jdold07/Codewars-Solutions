## Kata Description


The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.   

Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!



Here's the deal:



- It must start with a hashtag (`#`).

- All words must have their first letter capitalized.

- If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return `false`.

- If the input or the result is an empty string it must return `false`.





## Examples



```

" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata"  =>  "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"

"    Hello     World   "                  =>  "#HelloWorld"

""                                        =>  false

```
