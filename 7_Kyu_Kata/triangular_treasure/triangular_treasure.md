## Kata Description


Triangular numbers are so called because of the equilateral triangular shape that they occupy when laid out as dots. i.e.



```

1st (1)   2nd (3)    3rd (6)

*          **        ***

           *         **

                     *

```



You need to return the nth triangular number. You should return 0 for out of range values:



For example: (**Input --> Output**)



```

0 --> 0

2 --> 3

3 --> 6

-10 --> 0

```
