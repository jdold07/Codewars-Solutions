## Kata Description


# The museum of incredible dull things



The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.



However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.



# Task



Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. <span style="color:red">**Do not mutate the original array/list**</span>. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.



Don't change the order of the elements that are left.



### Examples



```

* Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output= [2,3,4,5]

* Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]

* Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1]

```
