## Kata Description


# Task



**_Given_** a **_Divisor and a Bound_** , *Find the largest integer N* , Such That , 



# Conditions :



* **_N_**  is *divisible by divisor*



* **_N_**  is *less than or equal to bound* 



* **_N_**  is *greater than 0*.

___



# Notes 



* The **_parameters (divisor, bound)_** passed to the function are *only positive values* .

* *It's guaranteed that* a **divisor is Found** .

___

~~~if:java

Java's default return statement can be any `int`, a divisor **will** be found.

~~~



~~~if:nasm

## NASM-specific notes



The function declaration is `int max_multiple(int divisor, int bound)` where the first argument is the divisor and the second one is the bound.
