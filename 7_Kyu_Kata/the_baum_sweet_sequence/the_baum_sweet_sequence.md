## Kata Description


[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Sweet_sequence): The Baum‚ÄìSweet sequence is an infinite automatic sequence of `0`s and `1`s defined by the rule:



b<sub>n</sub> = `1` if the binary representation of `n` contains no block of consecutive `0`s of odd length;  

b<sub>n</sub> = `0` otherwise;



for `n ‚â• 0`.



~~~if:javascript,php,coffeescript,typescript,

Define a generator function `baumSweet` that sequentially generates the values of this sequence.

~~~

~~~if:go,

Define a generator function `BaumSweet` that sequentially generates the values of this sequence.

~~~

~~~if:kotlin,

Define an iterator function `baumSweet` that sequentially generates the values of this sequence.

~~~

~~~if:haskell,

Define a list `baumSweet` that contains the values of this sequence.

~~~

~~~if:lambdacalc,

Define a stream `baumSweet` that contains the values of this sequence.

~~~

~~~if:fsharp,

Define a lazy sequence `baumSweet` that contains the values of this sequence.

~~~

~~~if:python,

Define a generator function `baum_sweet` that sequentially generates the values of this sequence.

~~~

~~~if:csharp,

Define an iterator `BaumSweet` that sequentially generates the values of this sequence.

~~~

~~~if:ruby,

Define a class `BaumSweet`, instantiating to an `Enumerator` that sequentially generates the values of this sequence.

~~~

~~~if:julia,

Define a function `baumsweet` that returns a `Generator` that sequentially generates the values of this sequence.

~~~

~~~if:lua,

Define an iterator `baumsweet` that sequentially generates each n and the n<sup>th</sup> value of this sequence.

~~~



~~~if-not:lambdacalc,

It will be tested for up to `1 000 000` values.

~~~

~~~if:lambdacalc,

It will be tested for up to `32k` values.

~~~



Note that the binary representation of `0` used here is not `0` but the empty string ( which does not contain any blocks of consecutive `0`s ).



~~~if:lambdacalc

#### Encodings



purity: `LetRec`  

numEncoding: `BinaryScott`  

export deconstructors `head, tail` for your `Stream` encoding ( a `Stream` is just an infinite `List`, without a `Nil` constructor )
