## Kata Description


Your job at E-Corp is both boring and difficult. It isn't made any easier by the fact that everyone constantly wants to have a meeting with you, and that the meeting rooms are always taken!



In this kata, you will be given an array. Each value represents a meeting room. Your job? Find the **first** empty one and return its index (N.B. There may be more than one empty room in some test cases). 

```

'X' --> busy

'O' --> empty

```

~~~if:cpp

If all rooms are busy, return `-1`

~~~

~~~if-not:cpp

If all rooms are busy, return `"None available!"`

~~~
