## Kata Description


It's tricky keeping track of who is owed what when spending money in a group. Write a function to balance the books.



* The function should take one parameter: an object/dict with two or more name-value pairs which represent the members of the group and the amount spent by each.

* The function should return an object/dict with the same names, showing how much money the members should pay or receive.



**Further points:**



* The values should be positive numbers if the person should receive money from the group, negative numbers if they owe money to the group.

* If value is a decimal, round to two decimal places.

 

Translations and comments (and upvotes!) welcome.



### Example



3 friends go out together: A spends ¬£20, B spends ¬£15, and C spends ¬£10. The function should return an object/dict showing that A should receive ¬£5, B should receive ¬£0, and C should pay ¬£5.



```javascript

var group = {

    A: 20, 

    B: 15, 

    C: 10

}



splitTheBill(group) // returns {A: 5, B: 0, C: -5}

```    

```python

group = {

    'A': 20, 

    'B': 15, 

    'C': 10

}



split_the_bill(group) # returns {'A': 5, 'B': 0, 'C': -5}

```        

```ruby

group = {

    'A'=>20, 

    'B'=>15, 

    'C'=>10

}



split_the_bill(group) # returns {'A'=>5, 'B'=>0, 'C'=>-5}

```    

```elixir

group = %{

  :A => 20,

  :B => 15,

  :C => 10

}



split_the_bill(group) # returns %{:A => 5, :B => 0, :C => -5}

```
