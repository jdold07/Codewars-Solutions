## Kata Description


Challenge:



Given a two-dimensional array of integers, return the flattened version of the array with all the integers in the sorted (ascending) order.



Example:



Given [[3, 2, 1], [4, 6, 5], [], [9, 7, 8]], your function should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].



```if:javascript

Addendum:



Please, keep in mind, that JavaScript is by default sorting objects alphabetically. For more information, please consult:
