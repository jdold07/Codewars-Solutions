## Kata Description


Let us begin with an example:



Take a number: `56789`. Rotate left, you get `67895`. 



Keep the first digit in place and rotate left the other digits: `68957`. 



Keep the first two digits in place and rotate the other ones: `68579`. 



Keep the first three digits and rotate left the rest:

`68597`. 

Now it is over since keeping the first four it remains only one digit which

rotated is itself.



You have the following sequence of numbers:



`56789 -> 67895 -> 68957 -> 68579 -> 68597`



and you must return the greatest: `68957`.



#### Task



~~~if-not:factor

Write `function max_rot(n)` which given a positive integer `n` returns the maximum number you got doing rotations similar to the above example.



So `max_rot` (or `maxRot` or ... depending on the language) is such as:



- `max_rot(56789) should return 68957`



- `max_rot(38458215) should return 85821534`

~~~



~~~if:factor

Write a word `max-rot ( n -- max )` which given a positive integer `n` returns the maximum number you got doing rotations similar to the above example.



Here are a few example inputs:



- `56789 max-rot` should return `68957`



- `38458215 max-rot` should return `85821534`

~~~
