## Kata Description


You have a string that consists of zeroes and ones. Now choose any two *adjacent* positions in the string: if one of them is `0`, and the other one is `1`, remove these two digits from the string.



Return the length of the resulting (smallest) string that you can get after applying this operation multiple times?



**Note:** after each operation, the remaining digits are separated by spaces and thus *not* adjacent anymore - see the examples below.





## Examples



 For `"01010"` the result should be `1`:

 

```python

"01010"  -->  "  010"  -->  "    0"

```

 

 

 For `"110100"` the result should be `2`:



```python

"110100"  -->  "1  100"  -->  "1    0"

```





## Input/Output



 - `[input]` string `s`



  The initial string.



 - `[output]` an integer



  The minimum length of the string that may remain after applying the described operations as many times as possible.
