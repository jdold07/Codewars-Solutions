## Kata Description


Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.



The binary number returned should be a string.



**Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation)))**

```

1, 1 --> "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)

5, 9 --> "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)

```
