## Kata Description


## Definition



Strong number is the number that *the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to number itself*.



For example, 145 is strong, since `1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145`.



## Task



Given a number, Find if it is Strong or not and return either `"STRONG!!!!"` or `"Not Strong !!"`.



### Notes 



* Number *passed is always*  Positive.

* Return *the result as* String



### Input >> Output Examples



```

strong_num(1) ==> return "STRONG!!!!"

```

Since, the sum of its `digits' factorial` (`1`) is equal to number itself, then its a Strong.



```

strong_num(123) ==> return "Not Strong !!"

```

Since the sum of its digits' factorial of `1! + 2! + 3! = 9` is not equal to number itself, then it's  Not Strong . 



```

strong_num(2)  ==>  return "STRONG!!!!"

```

Since the sum of its digits' factorial of `2! = 2` is equal to number itself, then its a Strong.



```

strong_num(150) ==> return "Not Strong !!"

```



Since the sum of its digits' factorial of `1! + 5! + 0! = 122` is not equal to number itself, Then it's Not Strong .
