## Kata Description


# Fun with ES6 Classes #2 - Animals and Inheritance



## Overview



Preloaded for you in this Kata is a ```class Animal```:



```javascript

class Animal {

  constructor(name, age, legs, species, status) {

    this.name = name;

    this.age = age;

    this.legs = legs;

    this.species = species;

    this.status = status;

  }

  introduce() {

    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;

  }

}

```

```csharp

public class Animal

{

  public int Age;

  public int Legs;

  public string Name;

  public string Species;

  public string Status;

  

  public Animal(string name, int age, int legs, string species, string status)

  {

    this.Name = name;

    this.Age = age;

    this.Legs = legs;

    this.Species = species;

    this.Status = status;

  }

  

  public virtual string Introduce()

  {

    return $"Hello, my name is {this.Name} and I am {this.Age} years old.";

  }

}

```



## Task



Define the following classes that inherit from ```Animal```.



### I. Shark



The constructor function for Shark should accept 3 arguments in total in the following order: `name, age, status`.  **All sharks should have a leg count of **`0`** (since they obviously do not have any legs) and should have a **`species`** of **`"shark"`**.**



### II. Cat



The constructor function for Cat should accept the same 3 arguments as with Shark: `name, age, status`.  Cats should always have a leg count of `4` and a species of `"cat"`.



Furthermore, the `introduce`/`Introduce` method for `Cat` should be identical to the original except there should be **exactly 2 spaces** and the words `"Meow meow!"` after the phrase.  For example:



```javascript

var example = new Cat("Example", 10, "Happy");

example.introduce() === "Hello, my name is Example and I am 10 years old.  Meow meow!"; // Notice the TWO spaces - very important

```

```csharp

Cat example = new Cat("Example", 10, "Happy);

example.Introduce() => "Hello, my name is Example and I am 10 years old.  Meow meow!"; // Notice the TWO spaces - very important

```



### III. Dog



The Dog constructor should accept 4 arguments in the specified order: `name, age, status, master`.  `master` is the name of the dog's master which will be a string.  Furthermore, dogs should have `4` legs and a species of `"dog"`.



Dogs have an identical `introduce`/`Introduce` method as any other animal, but they have their own method called `greetMaster`/`GreetMaster` which accepts no arguments and returns `"Hello (insert_master_name_here)"` (of course **not** the literal string but replace the `(insert_master_name_here)` with the name of the dog's master).
