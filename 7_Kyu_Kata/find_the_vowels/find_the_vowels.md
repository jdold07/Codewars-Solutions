## Kata Description


We want to know the index of the vowels in a given word, for example, there are two vowels in the word super (the second and fourth letters). 



So given a string "super", we should return a list of `[2, 4]`.



	Some examples:

	Mmmm  => []

	Super => [2,4]

	Apple => [1,5]

	YoMama -> [1,2,4,6]



### NOTES



* Vowels in this context refers to: a e i o u y (including upper case)

* This is indexed from `[1..n]` (not zero indexed!)
