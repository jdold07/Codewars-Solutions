## Kata Description


You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?



Complete the `findNextSquare` method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.  



If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then `-1` should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.



**Examples:(Input --> Output)**



```

121 --> 144

625 --> 676

114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square

```
