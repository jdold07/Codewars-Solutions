## Kata Description


Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them. 





```a``` and ```b``` will both be positive integers, and ```a``` will always be the first number in the operation, and ```b``` always the second.



The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply". 



~~~if-not:haskell

A few **examples:(Input1, Input2, Input3 --> Output)**

```

5, 2, "add"      --> 7

5, 2, "subtract" --> 3

5, 2, "multiply" --> 10

5, 2, "divide"   --> 2.5

```

~~~



~~~if:haskell

In **Haskell**:



  1. The operation is defined as

```haskell

data Operation = Add | Divide | Multiply | Subtract deriving (Eq, Show, Enum, Bounded)

```

  2. The arithmetic function as 

```haskell

arithmetic :: Double -> Double -> Operation -> Double

arithmetic :: Fractional a => a -> a -> Operation -> a

```

~~~





Try to do it without using if statements!
