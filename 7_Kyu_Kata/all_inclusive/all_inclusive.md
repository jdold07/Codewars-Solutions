## Kata Description


Input: 



- a string `strng`

- an array of strings `arr`



Output of function `contain_all_rots(strng, arr) (or containAllRots or contain-all-rots)`:



- a boolean `true` if all rotations of `strng` are included in `arr`

- `false` otherwise



#### Examples:

```

contain_all_rots(

  "bsjq", ["bsjq", "qbsj", "sjqb", "twZNsslC", "jqbs"]) -> true



contain_all_rots(

  "Ajylvpy", ["Ajylvpy", "ylvpyAj", "jylvpyA", "lvpyAjy", "pyAjylv", "vpyAjyl", "ipywee"]) -> false)

```



#### Note: 

Though not correct in a mathematical sense



- we will consider that there are no rotations of `strng == ""`

- and for any array `arr`: `contain_all_rots("", arr) --> true`



Ref: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)#Rotations>



```if:shell

## Bash:

For bash the array is replaced by a string (see "RUN sample tests"). 

```
