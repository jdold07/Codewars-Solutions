## Kata Description


This is a follow up from my kata <a href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/55d410c492e6ed767000004f'>The old switcheroo</a>







Write the function :

```javascript

function encode(str)

```

```python

def encode(str)

```

```ruby

def encode(str)

```

```coffeescript

encode = (str) ->

```

```csharp

public static string Encode(string str)

```

that takes in a string ```str``` and replaces all the letters with their respective positions in the English alphabet.<br/>



```javascript

encode('abc') == '123'   // a is 1st in English alpabet, b is 2nd and c is 3rd

encode('codewars') == '315452311819'

encode('abc-#@5') == '123-#@5'

```

```python

encode('abc') == '123'   # a is 1st in English alpabet, b is 2nd and c is 3rd

encode('codewars') == '315452311819'

encode('abc-#@5') == '123-#@5'

```

```ruby

encode('abc') == '123'   # a is 1st in English alpabet, b is 2nd and c is 3rd

encode('codewars') == '315452311819'

encode('abc-#@5') == '123-#@5'

```

```coffeescript

encode 'abc' == '123'   # a is 1st in English alpabet, b is 2nd and c is 3rd

encode 'codewars' == '315452311819'

encode 'abc-#@5' == '123-#@5'

```

```csharp

Encode("abc") == "123" // a is 1st in English alpabet, b is 2nd and c is 3rd

Encode("codewars") == "315452311819"

Encode("abc-#@5") == "123-#@5"

```

String are case sensitive.

```javascript

// Bonus point if you don't use toLowerCase()

```

```coffeescript

# Bonus point if you don't use toLowerCase()

```

```csharp

// Bonus point if you don't use ToLower()

```
