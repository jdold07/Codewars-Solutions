## Kata Description


**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students**



Create a function, called ``removeVowels`` (or ``remove_vowels``), that takes a string argument and returns that same string with all vowels removed (vowels are "a", "e", "i", "o", "u").



```javascript

removeVowels("drake") // => "drk"

removeVowels("aeiou") // => ""

```



```ruby

removeVowels("drake") # => "drk"

removeVowels("aeiou") # => ""

```



```cpp

remove_vowels("drake") // => "drk"

remove_vowels("aeiou") // => ""

```
