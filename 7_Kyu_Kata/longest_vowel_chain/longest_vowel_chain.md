The vowel substrings in the word `codewarriors` are `o,e,a,io`. The longest of these has a length of 2. Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only (both vowels and consonants) and no spaces, return the length of the longest vowel substring.

Vowels are any of `aeiou`. 



Good luck!
