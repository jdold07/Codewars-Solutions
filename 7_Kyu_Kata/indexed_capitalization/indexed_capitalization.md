## Kata Description


Given a string and an array of integers representing indices, capitalize all letters at the given indices. 



For example:



* `capitalize("abcdef",[1,2,5]) = "aBCdeF"`

* `capitalize("abcdef",[1,2,5,100]) = "aBCdeF"`. There is no index 100.



The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces and an array of digits.



Good luck!
