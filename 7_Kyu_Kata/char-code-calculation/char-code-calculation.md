## Kata Description


Given a string, turn each character into its ASCII character code and join them together to create a number - let's call this number `total1`:



```

'ABC' --> 'A' = 65, 'B' = 66, 'C' = 67 --> 656667

```



Then replace any incidence of the number `7` with the number `1`, and call this number 'total2':

```

total1 = 656667

              ^

total2 = 656661

              ^

```



Then return the difference between the sum of the digits in `total1` and `total2`:



```

  (6 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 7)

- (6 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 1)

-------------------------

                       6

```
