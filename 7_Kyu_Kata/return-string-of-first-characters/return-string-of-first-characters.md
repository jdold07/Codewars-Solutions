## Kata Description


In this exercise, a string is passed to a method and a new string has to be returned with the first character of each word in the string.



For example:



```

"This Is A Test" ==> "TIAT"

```



Strings will only contain letters and spaces, with exactly 1 space between words, and no leading/trailing spaces.
