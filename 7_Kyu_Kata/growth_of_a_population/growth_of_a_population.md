## Kata Description


In a small town the population is `p0 = 1000` at the beginning of a year. The population

regularly increases by `2 percent` per year and moreover `50` new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. 

How many years does the town need to see its population

greater or equal to `p = 1200` inhabitants?



```

At the end of the first year there will be: 

1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070 inhabitants



At the end of the 2nd year there will be: 

1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141 inhabitants (** number of inhabitants is an integer **)



At the end of the 3rd year there will be:

1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213



It will need 3 entire years.

```

More generally given parameters:



`p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to equal or surpass)`



the function `nb_year` should return `n` number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to `p`.



aug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)



```

Examples:

nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15

nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10

```



#### Note: 

Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.
