## Kata Description


You have an 8-wind compass, like this:

You receive the direction you are `facing` (one of the 8 directions: `N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW`) and a certain degree to `turn` (a multiple of 45, between -1080 and 1080); positive means clockwise, and negative means counter-clockwise.



Return the direction you will face after the turn.





## Examples



```python

"S",  180  -->  "N"

"SE", -45  -->  "E"

"W",  495  -->  "NE"

```

```haskell

S  180  ->  N

SE -45  ->  E

W  495  ->  NE

```
