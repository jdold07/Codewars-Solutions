## Kata Description


Odd bits are getting ready for 

[Bits Battles](https://www.codewars.com/kata/world-bits-war/).



Therefore the `n` bits march from right to left along an `8` bits path. Once the most-significant bit reaches the left their march is done. Each step will be saved as an array of `8` integers.



Return an array of all the steps.



`1 <= n <= 8`



NOTE:

`n != 0`, because `n` represents the number of `1`s.





## Examples



This resembles a simple 8 LED chaser:



```

n = 3



00000111

00001110

00011100

00111000

01110000

11100000

```



```

n = 7



01111111

11111110

```
