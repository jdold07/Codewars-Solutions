## Kata Description


Write a function that flattens an `Array` of `Array` objects into a flat `Array`.  Your function must only do one level of flattening.



```javascript

flatten([1,2,3]) // => [1,2,3]

flatten([[1,2,3],["a","b","c"],[1,2,3]])  // => [1,2,3,"a","b","c",1,2,3]

flatten([[[1,2,3]]]) // => [[1,2,3]]

```



```coffeescript

flatten [1,2,3] # => [1,2,3]

flatten [[1,2,3],["a","b","c"],[1,2,3]]  # => [1,2,3,"a","b","c",1,2,3]

flatten [[[1,2,3]]] # => [[1,2,3]]

```



```ruby

flatten [1,2,3] # => [1,2,3]

flatten [[1,2,3],["a","b","c"],[1,2,3]]  # => [1,2,3,"a","b","c",1,2,3]

flatten [[[1,2,3]]] # => [[1,2,3]]

```



```python

flatten [1,2,3] # => [1,2,3]

flatten [[1,2,3],["a","b","c"],[1,2,3]]  # => [1,2,3,"a","b","c",1,2,3]

flatten [[[1,2,3]]] # => [[1,2,3]]

```
