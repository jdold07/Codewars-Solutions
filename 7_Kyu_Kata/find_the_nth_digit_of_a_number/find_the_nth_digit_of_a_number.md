## Kata Description


Complete the function that takes two numbers as input, ```num``` and ```nth``` and return the `nth` digit of `num` (counting from right to left).



## Note

- If ```num``` is negative, ignore its sign and treat it as a positive value

- If ```nth``` is not positive, return `-1`

- Keep in mind that `42 = 00042`. This means that ```findDigit(42, 5)``` would return `0`



## Examples(```num```, ```nth``` --> output)



```

5673, 4 --> 5

129, 2 --> 2

-2825, 3 --> 8

-456, 4 --> 0

0, 20 --> 0

65, 0 --> -1

24, -8 --> -1

```
