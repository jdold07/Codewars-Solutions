## Kata Description


```if:javascript

JavaScript Arrays support a filter function (starting in JavaScript 1.6). Use the filter functionality to complete the function given. 

```

```if:csharp

Starting with .NET Framework 3.5, C# supports a `Where` (in the `System.Linq` namespace) method which allows a user to filter arrays based on a predicate. Use the `Where` method to complete the function given.



`Enumerable.Where` documentation:

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb534803(v=vs.110).aspx

```



```if:python

In Python, there is a built-in filter function that operates similarly to JS's filter. For more information on how to use this function, visit https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter

```



```if:haskell

Given list of integers return even integers on that list.

```

The solution would work like the following:

```javascript

getEvenNumbers([2,4,5,6]) // should == [2,4,6]

```



```csharp

Kata.GetEvenNumbers(new int[] {2, 4, 5, 6}) => new int[] {2, 4, 6}

```



```crystal

get_even_numbers([2,4,5,6]) => [2,4,6]

```



```r

get_even_numbers(c(2,4,5,6)) => c(2,4,6)

```



```julia

getevennumbers([2,4,5,6]) => [2,4,6]

```



```coffeescript

getEvenNumbers([2,4,5,6]) => [2,4,6]

```



```python

get_even_numbers([2,4,5,6]) => [2,4,6]

```



```ruby

get_even_numbers([2,4,5,6]) => [2,4,6]

```



```cpp

get_even_numbers({2,4,5,6}) => {2,4,6}

```



```haskell

getEvenNumbers [2,4,5,6] => [2,4,6]

```
