~~~if:scala

Return a list containing the numbers from 1 to N, where N is the parametered value.

~~~



Replace certain values however if any of the following conditions are met:

* If the value is a multiple of 3: use the value "Fizz" instead

* If the value is a multiple of 5: use the value "Buzz" instead

* If the value is a multiple of 3 & 5: use the value "FizzBuzz" instead



N will never be less than 1.



Method calling example:

```python

fizzbuzz(3) -->  [1, 2, "Fizz"]

```

```haskell

fizzbuzz(3) -->  ["1", "2", "Fizz"]

```

```kotlin

fizzBuzz(3) -->  ["1", "2", "Fizz"]

```

```csharp

string[] result = FizzBuzz.GetFizzBuzzArray(3); // => [ "1", "2", "Fizz" ]

```

```prolog

fizzify(3, [1, 2, "Fizz"]).

```

```scala

FizzBuzz.fizzify(3) // List("1", "2", "Fizz")

```
