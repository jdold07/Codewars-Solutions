## Kata Description


An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.



**Example: (Input --> Output)**

```if-not:factor

"Dermatoglyphics" --> true

"aba" --> false

"moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)

```



```if:factor

"Dermatoglyphics" -> t

"aba" -> f

"moOse" -> f (ignore letter case)

```
