## Kata Description


Your task is to return the sum of Triangular Numbers up-to-and-including the `nth` Triangular Number.



Triangular Number: "any of the series of numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc.) obtained by continued summation of the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc."



```

[01]

02 [03]

04 05 [06]

07 08 09 [10]

11 12 13 14 [15]

16 17 18 19 20 [21]

```



e.g. If `4` is given: `1 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 20`.



Triangular Numbers cannot be negative so return 0 if a negative number is given.
