## Kata Description


Given two integers `a` and `b`, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return `a` or `b`.



**Note:** `a` and `b` are not ordered!



## Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)



```

(1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)

(1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)

(0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)

(1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)

(-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)

(-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)

```
