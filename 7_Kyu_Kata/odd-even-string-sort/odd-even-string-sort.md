## Kata Description


Given a string <i><b>s. </b></i>

 You have to return another string such that even-indexed and odd-indexed characters of <i><b>s</b></i> are grouped and groups are space-separated (see sample below)

<pre>

Note: 

0 is considered to be an even index. 

All input strings are valid with no spaces

</pre>

<hr>

input:

<b>'CodeWars'</b>



output

<b>'CdWr oeas'</b>

<pre>

S[0] = 'C'

S[1] = 'o'

S[2] = 'd'

S[3] = 'e'

S[4] = 'W'

S[5] = 'a'

S[6] = 'r'

S[7] = 's'

</pre>



Even indices 0, 2, 4, 6, so we have <b>'CdWr'</b> as the first group<br/>

odd ones are 1, 3, 5, 7, so the second group is <b>'oeas'</b><br/>

And the final string to return is <b>'Cdwr oeas'</b><br/>

<hr>

Enjoy.
