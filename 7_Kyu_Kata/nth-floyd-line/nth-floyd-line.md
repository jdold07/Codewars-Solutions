## Kata Description


The [Floyd's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%27s_triangle) is a right-angled triangular array of natural numbers listing them in order, in lines of increasing length, so a Floyds triangle of size 6 looks like:



```

1

2  3

4  5  6

7  8  9  10

11 12 13 14 15

16 17 18 19 20 21

    ...

```



In this kata you're given a number, and expected to return the line number it falls in, in the Floyd's triangle



### Examples (input -> output)



```

3 -> 2 (i.e the number `3` falls in line 2 of the triangle)

17 -> 6

22 -> 7

499502 -> 1000

```



## Constraints



### 1 <= n <= 10<sup>9</sup>
