## Kata Description


In this Kata, you will be given a string that may have mixed uppercase and lowercase letters and your task is to convert that string to either lowercase only or uppercase only based on: 



* make as few changes as possible. 

* if the string contains equal number of uppercase and lowercase letters, convert the string to lowercase. 



For example:

```Haskell

solve("coDe") = "code". Lowercase characters > uppercase. Change only the "D" to lowercase.

solve("CODe") = "CODE". Uppercase characters > lowecase. Change only the "e" to uppercase.

solve("coDE") = "code". Upper == lowercase. Change all to lowercase.

```



More examples in test cases. Good luck!
