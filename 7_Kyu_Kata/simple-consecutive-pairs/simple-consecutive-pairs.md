## Kata Description


In this Kata your task will be to return the count of pairs that have consecutive numbers as follows:

```Haskell

pairs([1,2,5,8,-4,-3,7,6,5]) = 3

The pairs are selected as follows [(1,2),(5,8),(-4,-3),(7,6),5]

--the first pair is (1,2) and the numbers in the pair are consecutive; Count = 1

--the second pair is (5,8) and are not consecutive

--the third pair is (-4,-3), consecutive. Count = 2

--the fourth pair is (7,6), also consecutive. Count = 3. 

--the last digit has no pair, so we ignore.

```



More examples in the test cases. 



Good luck!
