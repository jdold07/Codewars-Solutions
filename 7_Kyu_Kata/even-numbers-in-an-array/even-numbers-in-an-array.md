## Kata Description


Given an `array` of numbers, return a new array of length `number` containing the last even numbers from the original array (in the same order). The original array will be not empty and will contain at least "number" even numbers.



For example:

```

([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 3) => [4, 6, 8]

([-22, 5, 3, 11, 26, -6, -7, -8, -9, -8, 26], 2) => [-8, 26]

([6, -25, 3, 7, 5, 5, 7, -3, 23], 1) => [6]



```
