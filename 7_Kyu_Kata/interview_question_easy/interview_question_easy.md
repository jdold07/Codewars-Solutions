## Kata Description


You receive the name of a city as a string, and you need to return a string that shows how many times each letter shows up in the string by using asterisks (`*`).



For example:



```

"Chicago"  -->  "c:**,h:*,i:*,a:*,g:*,o:*"

```



As you can see, the letter `c` is shown only once, but with 2 asterisks.



The return string should include **only the letters** (not the dashes, spaces, apostrophes, etc). There should be no spaces in the output, and the different letters are separated by a comma (`,`) as seen in the example above.



Note that the return string must list the letters in order of their first appearance in the original string.



More examples:

```

"Bangkok"    -->  "b:*,a:*,n:*,g:*,k:**,o:*"

"Las Vegas"  -->  "l:*,a:**,s:**,v:*,e:*,g:*"

```



Have fun! ;)
