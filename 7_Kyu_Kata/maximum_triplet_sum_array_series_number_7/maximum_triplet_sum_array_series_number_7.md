## Kata Description


# Task



**_Given_** an *array/list [] of n integers* , *find maximum triplet sum in the array* **_Without duplications_**   .

___



# Notes :



* **_Array/list_** size is *at least 3* .



* **_Array/list_** numbers could be a *mixture of positives , negatives and zeros* .



* **_Repetition_** of numbers in *the array/list could occur* , So **_(duplications are not included when summing)_**.

___

# Input >> Output Examples 



```cpp

1- maxTriSum ({3,2,6,8,2,3}) ==> return (17)

```

## **_Explanation_**:



* As the **_triplet_** that *maximize the sum* **_{6,8,3}_** in order , **_their sum is (17)_** 



* *Note* : **_duplications_** *are not included when summing* , **(i.e) the numbers added only once** .

___

```cpp

2- maxTriSum ({2,1,8,0,6,4,8,6,2,4}) ==> return (18)

```

## **_Explanation_**:



* As the **_triplet_** that *maximize the sum* **_{8, 6, 4}_** in order , **_their sum is (18)_** , 

* *Note* : **_duplications_** *are not included when summing* , **(i.e) the numbers added only once** .

___

```cpp

3- maxTriSum ({-7,12,-7,29,-5,0,-7,0,0,29}) ==> return (41)

```

## **_Explanation_**:



* As the **_triplet_** that *maximize the sum* **_{12 , 29 , 0}_** in order , **_their sum is (41)_** , 

* *Note* : **_duplications_** *are not included when summing* , **(i.e) the numbers added only once** .
