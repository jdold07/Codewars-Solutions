## Kata Description


In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes

the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity,

are named with letters from `a to m`. 



The colors used by the printer are

recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be

`aaabbbbhaijjjm` meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times

color b, one time color h then one time color a...



Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" 

control string is produced e.g. `aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm` with letters not from `a to m`.



You have to write a function `printer_error` which given a string will return

the error rate of the printer as a **string** representing a rational whose numerator 

is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string.

Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.



The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters 

from `a`to `z`.



#### Examples:



```

s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"

printer_error(s) => "0/14"



s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"

printer_error(s) => "8/22"



```
