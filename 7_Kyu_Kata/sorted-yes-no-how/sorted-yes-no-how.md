## Kata Description


Complete the method which accepts an array of integers, and returns one of the following:



* `"yes, ascending"` - if the numbers in the array are sorted in an ascending order

* `"yes, descending"` - if the numbers in the array are sorted in a descending order

* `"no"` - otherwise





You can assume the array will always be valid, and there will always be one correct answer.
