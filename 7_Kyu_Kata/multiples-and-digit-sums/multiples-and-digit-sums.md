## Kata Description


In this exercise, you will create a function that takes an integer, ```i```. With it you must do the following:



- Find all of its multiples up to and including 100,



- Then take the digit sum of each multiple (eg. 45 -> 4 + 5 = 9),



- And finally, get the total sum of each new digit sum.



**Note:** If the digit sum of a number is more than 9 (eg. 99 -> 9 + 9 = 18) then you do **NOT** have to break it down further until it reaches one digit.



**Example** (if ```i``` is 25):



Multiples of 25 up to 100 --> ```[25, 50, 75, 100]```



Digit sum of each multiple --> ```[7, 5, 12, 1]```



Sum of each new digit sum --> ```25```



**If you can, try writing it in readable code.**
