## Kata Description


Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.



Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever kills the other first is victorious. Death is defined as having `health <= 0`.



Each fighter will be a `Fighter` object/instance. See the Fighter class below in your chosen language.



Both `health` and `damagePerAttack` (`damage_per_attack` for python) will be integers larger than `0`. You can mutate the `Fighter` objects.



## Example:

```

  declare_winner(Fighter("Lew", 10, 2), Fighter("Harry", 5, 4), "Lew") => "Lew"

  

  Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 3 health.

  Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 6 health.

  Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 1 health.

  Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 2 health.

  Lew attacks Harry: Harry now has -1 health and is dead. Lew wins.

```



```javascript

function Fighter(name, health, damagePerAttack) {

		this.name = name;

		this.health = health;

		this.damagePerAttack = damagePerAttack;

		this.toString = function() { return this.name; }

}

```

```python

class Fighter(object):

    def __init__(self, name, health, damage_per_attack):

        self.name = name

        self.health = health

        self.damage_per_attack = damage_per_attack

        

    def __str__(self): return "Fighter({}, {}, {})".format(self.name, self.health, self.damage_per_attack)

    __repr__=__str__

```

```java

public class Fighter {

  public String name;

  public int health, damagePerAttack;

  public Fighter(String name, int health, int damagePerAttack) {

    this.name = name;

    this.health = health;

    this.damagePerAttack = damagePerAttack;

  }

}

```

```csharp

public class Fighter {

  public string Name;

  public int Health, DamagePerAttack;

  public Fighter(string name, int health, int damagePerAttack) {

    this.Name = name;

    this.Health = health;

    this.DamagePerAttack = damagePerAttack;

  }

}

```

```clojure

Technical note: The second fighter argument (f2) always attacks first.



(defrecord Fighter [name hp attack])

```

```cpp

class Fighter

{

private:

    std::string name;

    

    int health;

    

    int damagePerAttack;



public:

    Fighter(std::string name, int health, int damagePerAttack)

    {

        this->name = name;

        this->health = health;

        this->damagePerAttack = damagePerAttack;

    }

    

    ~Fighter() { };

    

    std::string getName()

    {

        return name;

    }

    

    int getHealth()

    {

        return health;

    }

    

    int getDamagePerAttack()

    {

        return damagePerAttack;

    }

    

    void setHealth(int value)

    {

        health = value;

    }

};

```

```go

type Fighter struct {

	Name            string

	Health          int

	DamagePerAttack int

}

```
