## Kata Description


## Oh no!

Some really funny web dev gave you a _sequence of numbers_ from his API response as an _sequence of strings_!



You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.



Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.



ie:``` ["1", "2", "3"] ``` to ``` [1, 2, 3] ```



Note that you can receive floats as well.
