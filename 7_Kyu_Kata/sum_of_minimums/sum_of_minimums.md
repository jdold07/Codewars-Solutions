## Kata Description


Given a 2D ( nested ) list ( array, vector, .. ) of size `m * n`, your task is to find the sum of the minimum values in each row.



For Example:



```text

[ [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]        #  minimum value of row is 1

, [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]        #  minimum value of row is 5

, [ 20, 21, 34, 56, 100 ]  #  minimum value of row is 20

]

```



So the function should return `26` because the sum of the minimums is `1 + 5 + 20 = 26`.



Note: You will always be given a non-empty list containing positive values.



ENJOY CODING :)
