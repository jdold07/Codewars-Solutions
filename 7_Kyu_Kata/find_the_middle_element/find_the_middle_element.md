## Kata Description


As a part of this Kata, you need to create a function that when provided with a triplet, returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.



The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).



For example:



    gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0



*2* is the number that fits between *1* and *3* and the index of *2* in the input array is *0*.



Another example (just to make sure it is clear):



    gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1

    

*10* is the number that fits between *5* and *14* and the index of *10* in the input array is *1*.
