## Kata Description


*Recreation of [Project Euler problem #6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)*



Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers `(1 <= n <= 100)` and the square of their sum.



## Example

For example, when `n = 10`:



* The square of the sum of the numbers is:



  (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025





* The sum of the squares of the numbers is:



 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> + 5<sup>2</sup> + 6<sup>2</sup> + 7<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385



Hence the difference between square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of those numbes is: 3025 - 385 = 2640
